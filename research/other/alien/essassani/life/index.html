          <h2 id="the-uniqueness-of-each-incarnation">The Uniqueness of Each Incarnation</h2>
<p>Each Soul extends portions of itself into time &amp; space as particular incarnations. Just as many fingers extend out from the same one hand, there are many incarnations at many points in time and space, all emanating from the same Soul.</p>
<p>From the point of view of your Soul (outside time &amp; space) all these incarnations (past incarnations, present incarnation, future incarnations) are all simultaneously occurring NOW. Although your Soul has many incarnations, each one is a unique &ldquo;version&rdquo; of you that in all eternity will never occur again. This incarnation of you, this version of you, will never occur again. So be the most you you can be! Be fully who you are! That is the fulfillment of your purpose.</p>
<h3 id="abundance">Abundance</h3>
<p>Abundance is the ability to do what you need to do, when you need to do it. Money is only one of many valid tools to achieve this abundance. And it is not always the most direct tool to use - for doing what you need to do when you need to do it.</p>
<h3 id="unified-society">Unified Society</h3>
<p>Unity in a society does not come from conformity. Unity can only come from granting equality and validity to the infinite diversity of all the individuals.  The universe is infinitely diverse.</p>
<p>Every being has their own way of exploring the idea of infinite creation, and all these ways are equally valid. When a society encourages the unique expression of each individual, that is when the society is strongest and most unified.</p>
<p>When you grant equality and validity to everyone, you are granting equality and validity to all aspects of Creation, and as a reflective result of this, the entire Creation supports you in everything you do as well!</p>
<h3 id="the-meaning-of-life-and-the-purpose-of-existence">The Meaning of Life, and The Purpose of Existence</h3>
<p>Existence is Eternal - without beginning.</p>
<p>Therefore Existence existed BEFORE the concept of &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; or &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; came into being.
Therefore, Existence does not need to have any particular &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; or &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; to justify its existence. It simply is.</p>
<p>In other words, the Infinite Creator set it all up as a blank slate (tabula rasa), so that YOU can superimpose absolutely ANY  &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; or &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; that you wish.</p>
<p>So, to be technically accurate, the universe is &ldquo;meaningless&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But this is a good thing!   It is truly a blessing!
The Infinite Creator has given YOU free will, so that you can now use your free will, to superimpose absolutely ANY  &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of life, or &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; of existence that you wish!</p>
<p>(Side Note: see Neutral Props)</p>
<h3 id="judgment-and-preference">Judgment and Preference</h3>
<p>Judgment is invalidating that which you do not prefer. Whenever you judge anything, by focusing your attention on it, you exchange energies with it, and so you &ldquo;become&rdquo; that vibration. So you automatically become the very thing you disapprove of.   You become that which you invalidate.  Preference, on the other hand, is not judgment.   Preference is exercising your ability to discern what is really &ldquo;you&rdquo;, what excites you, and then making choices aligned with the real &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  To prefer one thing does not necessitate invalidating those other things you do not prefer.</p>
<p>So the recommendation is:</p>
<p>Select what you prefer,
WITHOUT judging (invalidating) what you do NOT prefer.</p>
<p>You become whatever you focus your attention on.   To assign any meaning to anything - either a positive meaning or a negative meaning - is to invite that into your life.    Being neutral about something - assigning it no meaning - is the way to not attract that reality into your life.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; =========&gt; You are attracting that reality.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; =======&gt; You are attracting that reality.
&ldquo;I feel neutral about that.&rdquo; ===&gt; You are not attracting that reality.</p>
<p>Cease to invalidate yourself, because you are all you have to work with in your universe. You are the representation, in your own way, of the Infinite. If you invalidate that, or any part of that, then you do not allow yourself to function as a whole being capable of using information coming to you from others in a constructive way.   When you invalidate yourself, you are seriously handicapping your only reality-creation-engine.</p>
<h3 id="love--guilt--and--hate">Love,  Guilt,  and  Hate</h3>
<p>Love is knowing the deservability and worthiness of all.</p>
<p>Guilt is the belief in one&rsquo;s total lack of deservability and the belief in one&rsquo;s worthlessness.</p>
<p>Therefore, Guilt is the opposite of Love.
Hate is not the opposite of Love.</p>
<p>Hate is Love processed through judgment.
Hate is the polarized opposite of Love, but still implies deservability.</p>
<p>Co-Creating an Experience</p>
<p>Any experience that is shared by two or more people is the result of all the people involved agreeing to co-create that experience.    Even conflict can only occur if both parties agree to be in conflict.   You can only experience that which is resonant with the vibrations you are currently choosing to be.    If you &ldquo;believe&rdquo; you need to be protected, you are attracting into your reality the very thing you &ldquo;believe&rdquo; you need to be protected from.    If war is &ldquo;not of your vibration&rdquo;, there is no way you can experience war.   You can only experience that which you have - on some level - already agreed to experience.</p>
<h3 id="the-death-transition">The Death Transition</h3>
<p>When you are dreaming, the dream seems to be &ldquo;totally REAL!&rdquo;. Yet when you wake up, you realize that it was &ldquo;only a dream&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Right NOW, you are actually in Spirit. You are not in any physical dimension. You have never left Spirit.
Right NOW, you are in Spirit - dreaming that you are having this physical incarnation.</p>
<p>Right NOW, this dream of having a physical incarnation seems &ldquo;totally REAL!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yet, when you go through the &ldquo;death&rdquo; transition, you WAKE UP from this dream, and &ldquo;remember&rdquo; that you are actually Spirit.
And you realize, that this entire physcal incarnation experience was &ldquo;only a dream&rdquo;.</p>
<p>SIDE NOTE:</p>
<p>Just because it is &ldquo;just a dream&rdquo;, does not mean it is not &ldquo;real&rdquo;.
When your consciousness is focused within any TIME-SPACE-HOLOGRAM, it is &ldquo;real&rdquo;.
When your consciousness is focused outside of any TIME-SPACE-HOLOGRAM, that then seems to be an &ldquo;illusion&rdquo;.
Well, which is true?      &ldquo;Real&rdquo;  or  &ldquo;Illusion&rdquo; ?
They are BOTH correct and true!   It simple depends on your point of view (where your consciousness is focused - at any moment).</p>
<p>And&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;when you pass through the &ldquo;death transition&rdquo; and &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; from this dream, you are STILL dreaming:  but you are now in a higher-dimensional dream.
Both are equally &ldquo;real&rdquo;. Both are equally a &ldquo;dream&rdquo;.
And as you Ascend into higher and higher dimensions, you repeatedly &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; from that dream, into a more awake reality, but that is also a dream,
which you will realize when you ascend into an even higher dimension.</p>
<p>Thoughts are the only reality.
Dreams are the only reality.
Consciousness is the only reality.
Example: The chair you are sitting on is not actually &ldquo;real&rdquo;. But your EXPERIENCE of that chair is &ldquo;real&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>
<p>Just as a prism diffracts the unified white light into its component colors, the personality also functions as a prism, separating the holistic energy of the Soul into the 3 components of</p>
<p>Beliefs,  Emotions,   &amp;  Thought Patterns &amp; Actions.</p>
<p>Soul ====&gt; prism of Personality ====&gt; Beliefs ====&gt; Emotions ====&gt; Thought Patterns &amp; Actions</p>

<p>External Reality = Holographic Illusion</p>
<p>Our perceived &ldquo;external reality&rdquo; is actually an illusion (a holographic illusion) that is reflelcting (like a mirror) back to us our Beliefs, Thoughts, &amp; Feelings.
And, like a mirror, when you change your internal Beliefs, Thoughts, &amp; Feelings, the external reflection changes accordingly.
(A mirror does not have a mind of its own. It can only reflect back whatever is in front of it - whatever are your Beliefs, Thoughts, &amp; Feeling.)</p>
<p>HOW is all this occurring?    It is your Higher Mind that is functioning as a holographic mirror, to create a holographic bubble around you, that is your &ldquo;perceived external reality&rdquo;.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="visualization">Visualization</h3>
<p>The recommended way to use Visualization, to get some preferred reality, is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visualize the preferred reality within your Visualization intently.</li>
<li>This gets you into an EXCITED STATE   (from imagining you already have it).</li>
<li>Then totally DROP that visaulization and absolutely do not insist that it manifest in that particular form.</li>
<li>Your Higher Self then tunes into your EXCITED STATE and your desire,
and then begins working on getting for you a WAY BETTER outcome than anything you could have ever imagined.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE:
By hanging on to your Visualization and insisting that the outcome be in that form, you are LIMITING the optimum outcome, and preventing your Higher Self from bringing you an outcome that is FAR SUPERIOR to anything that you could have ever imagined or thought of.  And it can bring it to you in an easier and faster way, than the particular outcome you were insisting on.</p>
