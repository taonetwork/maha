          <ol start="25">
<li>We endeavour to affirm, concerning ourselves, and concerning what we love, everything that we can conceive to affect pleasurably ourselves, or the loved object.
On the contrary, we endeavour to negative everything, which we conceive to affect painfully ourselves or the loved object.</li>
</ol>
<!-- Proof: That, which we conceive to affect an object of our love pleasurably or painfully, affects us also pleasurably or painfully (3.21.).
But the mind (3.12.) endeavours, as far as possible, to conceive those things which affect us pleasurably; in other words (2.17. and Coroll.), it endeavours to regard them as present.
And, contrariwise (3.13.), it endeavours to exclude the existence of such things as affect us painfully;
Therefore, we endeavour to affirm concerning ourselves, and concerning the loved object, whatever we conceive to affect ourselves, or the love object pleasurably. Q.E.D.
 -->
<ol start="26">
<li>We endeavour to affirm, concerning that which we hate, everything which we conceive to affect it painfully.
Contrariwise, we endeavour to deny, concerning it, everything which we conceive to affect it pleasurably.</li>
</ol>
<!-- Proof: This proposition follows from III. xxiii., as the foregoing proposition followed from 3.21. Note: Thus we see that it may readily happen, that a man may easily think too highly of himself, or a loved object, and, contrariwise, too meanly of a hated object.
Pride is a feeling of a person who thinks too highly of himself.
It is a species of madness, wherein a man dreams with his eyes open, thinking that he can accomplish all things that fall within the scope of his conception.
He sees his accomplishments as real.
He exults in them as long as he:
is unable to conceive anything which excludes their existence, and
determines his own power of action.
Therefore, pride is pleasure springing from a man thinking too highly of himself.
The pleasure which arises from a man thinking too highly of another is called over-esteem.
Whereas the pleasure which arises from thinking too little of a man is called disdain. -->
<ol start="27">
<li>By the very fact that we conceive a thing, which is like ourselves, and which we have not regarded with any emotion, to be affected with any emotion, we are ourselves affected with a like emotion (affectus).</li>
</ol>
<!-- Proof: The images of things are modifications of the human body, whereof the ideas represent external bodies as present to us (2.17).
In other words (2.10.), whereof the ideas involve the nature of our body, and, at the same time, the nature of the external bodies as present.
If, therefore, the nature of the external body be similar to the nature of our body, then the idea which we form of the external body will involve a modification of our own body similar to the modification of the external body.
Consequently, if we conceive anyone similar to ourselves as affected by any emotion, this conception will express a modification of our body similar to that emotion.
Thus, from the fact of conceiving a thing like ourselves to be affected with any emotion, we are ourselves affected with a like emotion.
If, however, we hate the said thing like ourselves, we shall, to that extent, be affected by a contrary, and not similar, emotion. Q.E.D.
Note 1: This imitation of emotions, when it is referred to pain, is called compassion (cf. 3.22. note);
When it is referred to desire, it is called emulation, which is nothing else but the desire of anything, engendered in us by the fact that we conceive that others have the like desire. -->
<p>Corollary 1: If we conceive that anyone, whom we have hitherto regarded with no emotion, pleasurably affects something similar to ourselves, we shall be affected with love towards him.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we conceive that he painfully affects the same, we shall be affected with hatred towards him.</p>
<!-- Proof: This is proved from the last proposition in the same manner as 3.22. is proved from 3.21.  -->
<p>Corollary 2: We cannot hate a thing which we pity, because its misery affects us painfully.</p>
<!-- Proof: If we could hate it for this reason, we should rejoice in its pain, which is contrary to the hypothesis.  -->
<p>Corollary 3: We seek to free from misery, as far as we can, a thing which we pity.</p>
<!-- Proof: That, which painfully affects the object of our pity, affects us also with similar pain (by the foregoing proposition).
Therefore, we shall endeavour to recall everything which removes its existence, or which destroys it (cf. 3.13.).
In other words (3.9. note), we shall:
want to destroy it, or
be determined for its destruction.
Thus, we shall endeavour to free from misery a thing which we pity. Q.E.D.
 -->
<p>Note 2: This will or appetite for doing good, which arises from pity of the thing whereon we would confer a benefit, is called benevolence, and is nothing else but desire arising from compassion.
Concerning love or hate towards him who has done good or harm to something, which we conceive to be like ourselves, see 3.22. note.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>We endeavour to bring about whatsoever we conceive to conduce to pleasure. But we endeavour to remove or destroy whatsoever we conceive to be truly repugnant thereto, or to conduce to pain.</li>
</ol>
<!-- Proof: We endeavour, as far as possible, to conceive that which we imagine to conduce to pleasure (3.12.).
In other words (2.17.) we shall endeavour to conceive it as far as possible as present or actually existing.
But the endeavour of the mind, or the mind's power of thought, is equal to, and simultaneous with, the endeavour of the body, or the body's power of action.
(This is clear from 2.7. Coroll. and 2.11. Coroll.).
Therefore we make an absolute endeavour for its existence, in other words (which by 3.9. note, come to the same thing) we desire and strive for it; this was our first point.
Again, if we conceive that something, which we believed to be the cause of pain, that is (3.13. note), which we hate, is destroyed, we shall rejoice (3.20.).
We shall, therefore (by the first part of this proof), endeavour to destroy the same, or (3.13.) to remove it from us, so that we may not regard it as present.
This was our second point. Wherefore whatsoever conduces to pleasure, &c. Q.E.D. -->
<ol start="29">
<li>We shall also endeavour to do whatsoever we conceive men[6] to regard with pleasure, and contrariwise we shall shrink from doing that which we conceive men to shrink from.
[6] By &ldquo;men&rdquo; in this and the following propositions, I mean men whom we regard without any particular emotion.</li>
</ol>
<!-- Proof: From the fact of imagining, that men love or hate anything, we shall love or hate the same thing (3.27.).
That is (3.13. note), from this mere fact we shall feel pleasure or pain at the thing's presence.
And so we shall endeavour to do whatsoever we conceive men to love or regard with pleasure, etc. Q.E.D.
Note: This endeavour to do a thing or leave it undone, solely in order to please men, we call ambition, especially when we so eagerly endeavour to please the vulgar, that we do or omit certain things to our own or another's hurt.
In other cases it is generally called kindliness.
Furthermore, I give the name of praise to the pleasure, with which we conceive the action of another, whereby he has endeavoured to please us; but of blame to the pain wherewith we feel aversion to his action. -->
<ol start="30">
<li>If anyone has done something which he conceives as affecting other men pleasurably, he will be affected by pleasure, accompanied by the idea of himself as cause.
In other words, he will regard himself with pleasure. On the other hand, if he has done anything which he conceives as affecting others painfully, he will regard himself with pain.</li>
</ol>
<!-- Proof: He who conceives, that he affects others with pleasure or pain, will, by that very fact, himself be affected with pleasure or pain (3.27).
But, as a man (2.19 and 2.23) is conscious of himself through the modifications whereby he is determined to action, it follows that he who conceives, that he affects others pleasurably, will be affected with pleasure accompanied by the idea of himself as cause.
In other words, he will regard himself with pleasure.
And so mutatis mutandis in the case of pain. Q.E.D.
Note: Love (3.13) is pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause.
Hatred is pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause.
The pleasure and pain in question will be a species of love and hatred.
But 'love' and 'hatred' refer to external objects.
We will use other names for the emotions now under discussion.
Pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause[7] we will call Honour.
The emotion contrary to honour we will call Shame.
I mean in such cases as where pleasure or pain arises from a man's belief, that he is being praised or blamed.
Otherwise pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause[8] is called self-complacency.
Its contrary pain is called repentance.
It may happen (2.17 Coroll.) that the pleasure, wherewith a man conceives that he affects others, may exist solely in his own imagination, and as (3.25) everyone endeavours to conceive concerning himself that which he conceives will affect him with pleasure.
It may easily come to pass that a vain man may be proud and may imagine that he is pleasing to all, when in reality he may be an annoyance to all.
[7] So Van Vloten and Bruder. The Dutch version and Camerer read, "an internal cause." "Honor" = Gloria.

[8] See previous endnote. -->
<ol start="31">
<li>If we conceive that anyone loves, desires, or hates anything which we ourselves love, desire, or hate, we shall thereupon regard the thing in question with more steadfast love, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the contrary, if we think that anyone shrinks from something that we love, we shall undergo vacillations of soul.</p>
<!-- Proof: From the mere fact of conceiving that anyone loves anything we shall ourselves love that thing (3.27).
But we are assumed to love it already; there is, therefore, a new cause of love, whereby our former emotion is fostered; hence we shall thereupon love it more steadfastly.
Again, from the mere fact of conceiving that anyone shrinks from anything, we shall ourselves shrink from that thing (3.27).
If we assume that we at the same time love it, we shall then simultaneously love it and shrink from it.
In other words, we shall be subject to vacillation (III. xvii. note). Q.E.D.
 -->
<p>Corollary: From the foregoing, and also from 3.28 it follows that everyone endeavours, as far as possible, to cause others to love what he himself loves, and to hate what he himself hates: as the poet says: &ldquo;As lovers let us share every hope and every fear: ironhearted were he who should love what the other leaves.&quot;[9]
[9] Ovid, &ldquo;Amores,&rdquo; 2.19. 4,5. Spinoza transposes the verses.</p>
<!-- "Speremus pariter, pariter metuamus amantes; Ferreus est, si quis, quod sinit alter, amat." Note: This endeavour to bring it about, that our own likes and dislikes should meet with universal approval, is really ambition (see 3.29 note).
Wherefore we see that everyone by nature desires (appetere), that the rest of mankind should live according to his own individual disposition: when such a desire is equally present in all, everyone stands in everyone else's way, and in wishing to be loved or praised by all, all become mutually hateful.
Proposition 32. If we conceive that anyone takes delight in something, which only one person can possess, we shall endeavour to bring it about that the man in question shall not gain possession thereof. Proof: From the mere fact of our conceiving that another person takes delight in a thing (3.27 and Coroll.) we shall ourselves love that thing and desire to take delight therein.
But we assumed that the pleasure in question would be prevented by another's delight in its object; we shall, therefore, endeavour to prevent his possession thereof (3.28). Q.E.D.
Note: We thus see that man's nature is generally so constituted, that he takes pity on those who fare ill, and envies those who fare well with an amount of hatred proportioned to his own love for the goods in their possession. Further, we see that from the same property of human nature, whence it follows that men are merciful, it follows also that they are envious and ambitious.
Lastly, if we make appeal to Experience, we shall find that she entirely confirms what we have said; more especially if we turn our attention to the first years of our life.
We find that children, whose body is continually, as it were, in equilibrium, laugh or cry simply because they see others laughing or crying; moreover, they desire forthwith to imitate whatever they see others doing, and to possess themselves of whatever they conceive as delighting others: inasmuch as the images of things are, as we have said, modifications of the human body, or modes wherein the human body is affected and disposed by external causes to act in this or that manner. -->
