          <p>The gold and silver mines in the West-Indies owned by the King of Spain have the greatest value of all mines.</p>
<p>This allows the King of Spain to rule over many good Italian states and enlarge his dominions by a continual war through the power of his money. His money is dispersed into so many countries. Yet it is united in supplying his wants both for war and peace in a plentiful manner from all the parts of Christendom. All Christendom therefore are the partakers of his treasure through Commerce. Spanish policy has tried to prevent all other Nations from getting this treasure as much as it could.</p>
<p>The Spanish know that they and the West Indies are too poor and barren to supply it themselves. Their Money therefore must supply it for them by advantageously trafficking East-Indies resources to gain of the West.</p>
<p>They used the rich goods of the West to barter with all the parts of Christendom for their Commodities to furnish their own necessities. This prevented others for carrying away their money. They saw it as less dangerous to send them to the remote Indians, than to their neighbour Princes who could use them to fund their enemies.</p>
<p>This Spanish policy against others is the more remarkable. Every 1 Rial of Eight they sent to the East-Indies brought home so much wares as saved them the spending of 5 Rials of Eight here in Europe. But now this great profit is failed, and the English, Dutch, and others partake in those East-India trades just as the Spanish did.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Spanish also have a cancer of war, which infinitely exhausts their treasure and disperses it into Christendom. This kind of war is far different from a local war where the Soldier receives money-wages which he spends locally, keeping the money in the Kingdom, although it be exhausted from the King.</p>
<!-- : even to their enemies through reprisal and especially through maintaining those armies composed of strangers and are so far away that they cannot feed, clothe, or provide them with their own native goods.
They must receive this relief from other nations -->
<p>The Spaniard (trusting in the power of his Treasure) undertakes wars in Germany and in other remote places. This soon beggars the richest Kingdom of all their money. The lack of money then brings disorder to the armies.</p>
<!-- , as it falls out sometimes with Spain it self, who have the Fountain of money, when either it is stopped in the passage by the force of their enemies, or drawn out faster than it flows by their own occasions; whereby also we often see that Gold and silver is so scant in Spain, that they are forced to use base copper money, to the great confusion of their Trade, and not without the undoing also of many of their own people. -->
<p>Did all nations get the treasure that Spain lost?</p>
<p>I answer no, because some countries by war or excess also lose what they had gotten.</p>
