          <p>The Balance of our Forraign Trade is the true rule of our Treasure.</p>
<p>How can the said ballance may bedrawn up at all times, when it shall please the
State to discover how we prosper or decline in this great and weighty business,
wherein the Officers of his Majesties Customes are the onely Agents to be
employed, because they have the accounts of all the wares which are issued out
or brought into the Kingdom</p>
<p>although (it is true) they cannot exactly set
down the cost and charges of other mens goods bought here or beyond the
seas; yet nevertheless, if they ground themselves upon the book of Rates, they
shall be able to make such an estimate as may well satisfie this enquiry: for it
is not expected that such an account can possible be drawn up to a just
ballance, it will suffice onely that the difference be not over great.
First therefore, concerning our Exportations, when we have valued their first
cost, we must add twenty-five per cent. thereunto for the charges here, for
fraight of Ships, ensurance of the Adventure, and the Merchants Gains; and for
our Fishing Trades, which pay no Customs to his Majesty, the value of such
Exportations may be easily esteem&rsquo;d by good observations which have been
made, and may continually be made, according to the increase or decrease of
those affairs, the present estate of this commodity being valued at one hundred
and forty thousand pounds issued yearly. Also we must add to our
Exportations all the moneys which are carried out in Trade by license from his
Majesty.</p>
<p>Secondly, for our Importations of Forraign Wares, the Custome-books serve
onely to direct us concerning the quantity, for we must not value them as they
39Thomas Mun, Englandâ€™s Treasure
are rated here, but as they cost us with all charges laden into our Ships beyond
the Seas, in the respective places where they are bought: for the Merchants
gain, the charges of Insurance, Fraight of Ships, Customes, Imposts, and other
Duties here, which doe greatly indear them unto our use and consumption, are
not withstanding but Commutations amongst our selves, for the Stranger hath
no part thereof: wherefore our said Importations ought to be valued at twenty
five per cent. less than they are rated to be worth here. And although this may
seem to be too great allowance upon many rich Commodities, which come but
from the Low Countreys and other places neer hand, yet will it be found
reasonable, when we consider it in gross Commodities, and upon Wares laden
in remote Countreys, as our Pepper, which cost us, with charges, but four
pence the pound: so that when all is brought into a medium, the valuation
ought to be made as afore-written. And therefore, the order which hath been
used to multiply the full rates upon wares inwards by twenty, would produce a
very great errour in the Ballance, for in this manner the ten thousand bags of
Pepper, which this year we have brought hither from the East Indies, should be
valued at very near two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, whereas all this
Pepper in the Kingdomes accompt, cost not above fifty thousand pounds,
because the Indians have had no more of us, although we paid them
extraordinary dear prices for the same. All the other charges (as I have said
before) is but a charge of effects amongst our selves, and from the Subject to
the King, which cannot impoverish the Common-wealth. But it is true, that
whereas nine thousand bags of the said Peper are already shipped out for
divers forraign parts; These and all other Wares, forraign or domestick, which
are thus transported Outwards, ought to be cast up by the rates of his Majesties
Custome-money, multiplyed by twenty, or rather by twenty five (as I conceive)
which will come neerer the reckoning, when we consider all our Trades to
bring them into a medium.
Thirdly, we must remember, that all Wares exported or imported by
Strangers (in their shipping) be esteemed by themselves, for what they carry
out, the Kingdom hath only the first cost and the custom: And what they bring
in, we must rate it as it is worth here, the Custom, Impost, and pety charges
only deducted.
Lastly, there must be good notice take of all the great losses which we
receive at Sea in our Shipping either outward or homeward bound: for the
value of the one is to be deducted from our Exportations, and the value of the
other is to be added to our Importations: for to lose and to consume doth
produce one and the same reckoning. Likewise if it happen that His Majesty
doth make over any great sums of mony by Exchange to maintain a forraign
war, where we do not feed and clothe the Souldiers, and Provide the armies,
we must deduct all this charge out of our Exportations or add it to our
Importations; for this expence doth either carry out or hinder the coming in of
so much Treasure. And here we must remember the great collections of mony
which are supposed to be made throughout the Realm yearly from our
Recusants by Priests and Jesuits, who secretly convey the same unto their
Colleges, Cloysters and Nunneries beyond the Seas, from whence it never
returns to us again in any kind; therefore if this mischief cannot be prevented,
yet it must be esteemed and set down as a cleer loss to the Kingdome, except
(to ballance this) we will imagine that as great a value may perhaps come in
from forraign Princes to their Pensioners here for Favours or Intelligence,
which some States account good Policy, to purchase with great Liberality; the
receipt whereof notwithstanding is plain Treachery.
There are yet some other petty things which seem to have reference to this
Ballance, of which the said Officers of His Majesties Customs can take no
notice, to bring them into the accompt. As namely, the expences of travailers,
the gifts to Ambassadors and Strangers, the fraud of some rich goods not
entred into the Custom-house, the gain which is made here by Strangers by
change and re-change, Interest of mony, ensurance upon English mens goods
and their lives: which can be little when the charges of their living here is
deducted; besides that the very like advantages are as amply ministred unto the
English in forraign Countreys, which doth counterpoize all these things, and
therefore they are not considerable in the drawing up of the said Ballance.</p>
