          <!-- Now that we have set down the true course by which a Kingdom may be enriched with treasure; In the next place we will endavour to shew the ways and means by which a King may justly share therein without the hurt or oppression of his Subjects. -->
<p>The Revenues of Princes depend on their riches and on the trade of their respective dominions. These depend on the constitution of the Countreys, the government, laws, and customs of the people. The Prince can only alter these with much difficulty and danger.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some Kings have their Crown Lands, Church lands, Customs, Tolls and Imposts on all imports and exports, Loans, Donations and Subsidies.</li>
<li>Other States omit the last three and focus on the former as sales taxes and fees on the marriage money of women, licence mony upon all Victualling houses and Inkeepers, head mony, Custom upon all Corn, Wine, Oyl, Salt and the like. These oppress the people and make them poor and miserable expecially where they are laid at heavy rates at 4% to 7%.</li>
</ul>
<!-- But when all the circumstances and distinction of places are duly considered, they will be found not only necessary and therefore lawful to be used in some States, but also in divers respects very profitable to the Commonwealth.  -->
<p>Some States like Venice, Florence, Genoa, the Netherlands, etc. have both natural and artificial strength and rich Subjects. But their territories are small. This forces them to strengthen themselves with confederations and Leagues which may often fail them in their greatest need. And so they also mass up store of treasure and Munition for defense by themselves.</p>
<!-- yet being of no very great extent, nor enjoying such wealth by ordinary revenues as might support them against the suddain and powerful invasions of those mighty Princes which do inviron them; 

they are therefore enforced to 
 -->
<p>These heavy Contributions are not so hurtful because these are collected by excise. This transfers the burden onto the rich instead of the poor. The rich do not neglect their duty to pay taxes as the collapse of the country would hurt themselves.</p>
<!-- for as the food and rayment of the poor is made dear by Excise, so doth the price of their labour rise in proportion; whereby the burden (if any be) is still upon the rich, who are either idle, or at least work not in this kind, yet have they the use and are the great consumers of the poors labour:  -->
<!-- . to advance their endeavours according to those times which do exhaust their means and revenues; wherein if they should peradventure fail, and therfore be forced to abate their sinful excess and idle retainers. -->
<p>What is all this but happiness in a Commonwealth, when vertue, plenty and arts shall thus be advance all together?</p>
<p>A Kingdom is always impoverished if the king gains from the loss of the people. This is because his gains can be spend for the benefit of his Subjects. <!-- ; except only that part of the treasure which is laid up for the publique good; wherein likewise they are both just and profitable. --> The best things may be corrupted. These taxes may be abused and the Treasure can be vainly wasted by a Prince. But these disorders are seldom seen in the States aforenamed because the disposing of the publique treasure is in the power and discretion of many. Governments know that such Excesses are ruinous as they cause great want and poverty. And so it is common policy amongst Princes to prevent such mischiefs with great care and providence.</p>
<!-- by doing nothing that may cause the Nobility to despair of their safety, nor leaving any thing undone which may gain the good will of the Commonalty to keep all in due obedience.  -->
<!--  not of one and the same constitution, for that which is Physick to one man, is little better than poyson to another. The States aforewritten need those extraordinary contributions to because they are not able otherwise to short time to raise sufficient treasure to defend themselves against a potent enemy, who hath power to invade them on the sudden, as is already declared. -->
<p>Not all states are the same. A mighty Prince can get enough ordinary revenues if his:</p>
<ul>
<li>dominions are great and united</li>
<li>Subjects many and Loyal</li>
<li>lands rich both by nature and traffique</li>
<li>Victuals and war provisions plentiful and ready</li>
<li>situation easy to offend others, and dificult to be invaded,</li>
<li>harbours good,</li>
<li>Navy strong,</li>
<li>alliances powerful</li>
<li>royalty is enough to support the Majesty of his State</li>
</ul>
<p>These allow him to defend against invasion without the need for extraordinary and heavy taxes.</p>
<!--  shall not the wealthy and loyal subjects of such a great and just Prince maintain his Honour and their own Liberties with life and goods, alwayes supplying the Treasure of their Soveraign, untill by a well ordered War he may inforce a happy Peace?

Yes verily, it cannot otherwise be expected. And thus shall a mighty Prince be more powerful in preserving the wealth and love of his Subjects, than by treasuring up their riches with unnecessary taxes, which cannot but alter and provoke them. -->
<!-- Yea, but say some men, we may easily contradict all this by example taken from some of the greatest Monarchs of Christendome, who, besides those Incomes which here are termed ordinary, they adde likwise all, or the most of the other heavy Contributions.
 -->
<p>They can also sell their Offices &amp; Places of Justice. But it is an act both base &amp; wicked because it robs worthy men of their Merits, &amp; betrays the cause of the innocent. These things should not be lawful just because they are necessary. These exactions are not used for defence but for the covetousness to add Kingdome to Kingdom.</p>
<!-- , and so to usurp the right of others: which actions of Impiety are ever shadowed with some fair pretence of Sanctity, as being done for the Catholic Cause, the propagation of the Church, the suppression of Hereticks, and such like delusions, serving onely to further their own ambition, whereof in this place it shall be needless to make any larger discourse.
