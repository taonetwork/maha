              <h2 style="margin: 0 !important;">Chapter 10 and 11 of England&rsquo;s Treasure on Foreign Trade by Thomas Mun</h2>

          <p>Keeping our money in the nation is just as useless as debasing our money because the causes of their preservation and production are the same in nature. The statute to allow free importation aims to employ foreign goods into our commodities. They say that the statute&rsquo;s intent is for encourage imports to be employed in our commodities which will then be exported at a higher value than imports. It might seem as a good policy to increase our wealth.</p>
<p>But on further examination, we shall find that it cannot produce such good effects. This is because it delays the payment and inflow of money. In other countries, we sell our goods and take their money because they have few goods that we need. In some places, we need their commodities but they have little use of ours, so they take our money.</p>
<!-- This is because foreign trade is the same to all nations, so may we easily perceive what will be done therein by strangers. -->
<!-- by which we do not only seek with the sale of our own commodities to supply our wants of foreign goods, but also to enrich ourselves with money.
all which is done by a different manner of trading according to our own occasions and the nature of the places whereunto we do trade; as namely in some Countries we sell our commodities and bring away their wares, or part in money.
 -->
<!-- But it is wrong because we need to import money as well.  -->
<!-- All accomplish the whole body of the trade, which will ever languish if the harmony of her health be distempered by the diseases of excess at home, violence abroad, charges and restrictions at home or abroad: but in this place I have occasion to speak only of restriction, which I will perform briefly. -->
<p>There are three ways a merchant may exchange his goods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Through money</li>
<li>Through commodities</li>
<li>Through barter</li>
</ol>
<p>The Statute of employment restrains money and bills of exchange. It is unique only to our country. This will violate the Law of Commerce in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>This law will lead to reciprocal laws in other countries.  This will reduce our imports and exports and cause our foreign trade to decay. It will deprive us of the money-revenues from foreign trade. Without such treasure, we cannot sell to distant places. This would cause our trade and treasure to decay together. Other countries will impose the same law against us, reducing the treasure in foreign trade.</li>
</ol>
<!-- And thus in the first place we should be deprived of that freedom and means which now we have to bring Treasure into the Kingdom, and therewith likewise we should lose the vent of much wares which we carry to divers places, whereby our trade and our Treasure would decay together. -->
<!-- It is an Act without example in any place of the world where we have trade.
therefore to be considered, that whatsoever (in this kind) we shall impose upon strangers here, will presently be made a Law for us in their Countreys, expecially where we have our greatest trade with our vigilant neighbours, who omit no care nor occasion to support their traffique in equal privileges with other Nations. -->
<!--  -->
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>It allows exports only through English state-owned corporations. This causes our private merchants, sailors, and shipping to have recourse to those corporations. It would make our goods cheaper to foreign buyers than if we sold it to them in their own countries, as explained in Chapter 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our money will go overseas if we import more than we export.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- Thirdly, whereas we have already sufficiently shewed, that if our commodities be over ballance in value by forraign wares, our mony must be carried out. -->
<p>How can we repeal this statute? Can we restrain foreigners while letting the English loose?</p>
<!-- shall not the same reason and advantage cause that to be done by them now, that was done by the other before?
or if we will make a statute (without example) to prevent both alike, shall we not then overthrow all at once?
 -->
<p>It will destroy much trade which will reduce the customs revenue and profits of the Kingdom. This statute, when reciprocated by foreign statues, will keep our money in the Kingdom. This remedy is far worse than the disease.<!-- Its restrictions will affect not only foreign trade, but also the international movement of our money --></p>
<!-- the King in his customes and the Kingdom in her profits; for such a restriction must of necessity , because the diversity of occasions and places which make an ample trade require that some men should both export and import wares; some export only, others import, some deliver out their monies by exchange, others take it up; some carry out mony, others bring it in, and this in a greater or lesser quantity according to the good husbandry or excess in the Kingdom, over which only if we keep a strict law, it will rule all the rest, and without this all other Statutes are no rules either to keep or procure us Treasure. -->
<!-- shall we not life more like Irishmen than Englishmen, when the Kings revenues, our Merchants, Mariners, Shipping, Arts, Lands, Riches, and all decay together with our Trade? -->
 <!-- , thereby to keep our money in the Kingdom: So we doubt not but send out a sufficient quantity of our own wares over and above to bring in the value thereof in ready money. -->
<!-- Although this is absolutely denied by the reasons afore written, yet now we will grant it, because we desire to end the dispute: -->
<p>It is true that other Nations will sell more of our commodities than we consume of theirs. But this would happen anyway without the Statute. All the Statute does is to add hurtful restrictions.</p>
<!-- , then I affirm that the overplus must necessarily return unto us in treasure without the use of the Statute, which is therefore not onley fruitless but hurtful, as some other like restrictions are found to be when they are fully discovered. -->
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-11-exporting-our-food-and-weapons-for-money-will-not-increase-our-wealth">Chapter 11: Exporting our food and weapons for money will not increase our wealth</h2>
<p>The food and weapons for war are so precious in a nation. It should be restrained from being sold overseas or it should be charged a high price because Spain and other countries willingly buy such goods.</p>
<p>We must gain in every exchange and bring in treasure into our nation. This gain can only be done by the overbalance of our trade. This overbalance is reduced by restrictions. Therefore, such restrictions hinder the increase of our wealth.</p>
<p>Vain men think that we should not restrict the exports of food or weapons<!-- restrictions would not reduce our other exports -->. But if this were true, the exports of such food and weapons would still not give us more money.  This is because what goes in must come out. Only the overbalance of the trade can give us real gains.</p>
<!-- 
for whatsoever is forced in one way must out again another way: because onely so much will remain and abide withus as is gained and incorporated into the estate of the Kingdom by .
