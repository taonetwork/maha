          <div class="left conf">
Confucius: The first to make progress in the Proprieties and in Music are plain farmers.
<p>After them, the men of higher standing. If I had to employ any of them, I would choose the farmers.</p>
<p>Of those who were with me when I was in the Ch&rsquo;in and Ts&rsquo;ai States, not one now is left to approach my door.</p>
<p>As for Hwui, he is not one to help me on.
There is nothing I say but he is not well satisfied with.
What a dutiful son was Min Tsz-k&rsquo;ien!
No one finds occasion to differ from what his parents and brothers have said of him.</p>
<p>Nan Yung used to repeat three times over the lines in the Odes about the white sceptre.</p>
</div>
<p>Confucius caused his own elder brother&rsquo;s daughter to be given in marriage to him.</p>
<div class="right kikang">
Ki K'ang: which of the disciples were fond of learning?
</div>
<div class="left conf">
Confucius: There was one Yen Hwui who was fond of it. But unfortunately he died early. Now his like is not to be found.
<p>When Yen Yuen died, his father, Yen Lu, begged for the Master&rsquo;s carriage in order to get a shell for his coffin.</p>
<p>Ability or no ability every father still speaks of &lsquo;my son&rsquo;.
When &lsquo;my own son&rsquo; Li died, and the coffin for him had no shell to it, I know I did not go on foot to get him one.
But that was because I was, though retired, in the wake of the ministers, and could not therefore well do so.</p>
</div>
<p>On the death of Yen Yuen the Master exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah me! Heaven is ruining me, Heaven is ruining me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the same occasion, his wailing for that disciple becoming excessive, those who were about him said, &ldquo;Sir, this is too much!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="left conf">
Confucius: "Too much? If I am not to do so for him, then for whom else?" 
</div>
<p>The disciples then wished for the deceased a grand funeral. The Master could not on his part consent to this. They nevertheless gave him one.</p>
<p>Upon this he remarked:</p>
<div class="left conf">
He used to look upon me as if I were his father. I could never, however, look on him as a son. Twas not my mistake, but yours, my children.
</div>
<hr>
<div class="right tsz-lu">
Where there is scarcely the ability to minister to living men, how shall there be ability to minister to the spirits?
</div>
<div class="left conf">
Confucius: Where there is scarcely any knowledge about life, how shall there be any about death?" 
</div>
<p>The disciple Min was by his side, looking affable and bland; Tsz-lu also, looking careless and intrepid; and Yen Yu and Tsz-kung, firm and precise.</p>
<p>The Master was cheery.</p>
<div class="left conf">
"One like Tsz-lu there does not come to a natural end." 
</div>
<p>Some persons in Lu were taking measures in regard to the Long Treasury House. Min Tsz-k&rsquo;ien observed, &ldquo;How if it were repaired on the old lines?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="left conf">
This fellow is not a talker, but when he does speak he is bound to hit the mark!" "There is Yu's harpsichord," "what is it doing at my door?" 
</div>
<p>On seeing, however, some disrespect shown to him by the other disciples, he added,</p>
<div class="left conf">
"Yu has got as far as the top of the hall; only he has not yet entered the house." 
</div>
<div class="right tsz-kung">
Who is the worthier? Tsz-chang or Tsz-hi? 
</div>
<div class="left conf">
Tsz-chang goes beyond the mark. Tsz-hi falls short of it. 
</div>
<div class="right tsz-kung">
So then Tsz-chang is better?
</div>
<div class="left conf">
To go too far is about the same as to fall short.
</div>
