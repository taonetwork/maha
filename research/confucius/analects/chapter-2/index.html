          <div class="left conf">
Confucius: "Let a ruler base his government upon virtuous principles, and he will be like the pole-star, which remains steadfast in its place, while all the host of stars turn towards it.
<p>The &lsquo;Book of Odes&rsquo; has 300 pieces.
But one expression in it can cover the purport of all, namely unswerving mindfulness.
The people will become evasive and devoid of any sense of shame if they are governed simply by statute, pains and penalties.
They will develop a sense of shame and know their errors if they are governed by principles of virtue and the Rules of Propriety.
When I reached 15, I became bent on study.</p>
<p>At 30, I was a confirmed student.
At 40, nought could move me from my course.
At 50, I comprehended the will and decrees of Heaven.
At 60, my ears were attuned to them.
At 70, I could follow my heart&rsquo;s desires, without overstepping the lines of rectitude.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right mang">
Mang-i: What does filial piety consist in?
</div>
<div class="left conf">
It is in not being perverse.
<p>We should always follow the Rules of Propriety with regard to our parents:
in ministering to them while living,
in burying them when dead, and
in offering sacrificial gifts to them.
Parents should bear only one trouble: their own sickness.
The filial piety of the present day simply means the being able to support one&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>This extends even to the case of dogs and horses.
All of these can support them.
If there is no reverential feeling, what is there to distinguish between the cases?</p>
<p>The manner is the difficulty.</p>
<p>If, in the case of work to be done, the younger folks simply take upon themselves the toil of it.
Or if, in the matter of meat and drink, they simply set these before their elders is this to be taken as filial piety?
I have conversed with Hwi the whole day long</p>
<p>He has controverted nothing that I have said, as if he were without wits.
But when his back was turned, and I looked attentively at his conduct apart from me, I found it satisfactory in all its issues.
No, indeed! Hwi is not without his wits.
&ldquo;If you observe what things people (usually) take in hand, watch their motives, and note particularly what it is that gives them satisfaction, shall they be able to conceal from you what they are? Conceal themselves, indeed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be versed in ancient lore, and familiarize yourself with the modern; then may you become teachers.
&ldquo;The great man is not a mere receptacle.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="left conf">
In reply to Tsz-kung respecting the great man: "What he first says, as a result of his experience, he afterwards follows up. "The great man is catholic-minded, and not one-sided. The common man is the reverse. "Learning, without thought, is a snare; thought, without learning, is a danger. "Where the mind is set much upon heterodox principles there truly and indeed is harm." 
</div>
<div class="left conf">
Confucious to the disciple Tsz-lu: Shall I give you a lesson about knowledge? When you know a thing, maintain that you know it; and when you do not, acknowledge your ignorance. This is characteristic of knowledge." 
</div>
<p>Tsz-chang was studying with an eye to official income. The Master addressed him thus</p>
<div class="left conf">
Of the many things you hear hold aloof from those that are doubtful, and speak guardedly with reference to the rest; your mistakes will then be few. Also, of the many courses you see adopted, hold aloof from those that are risky, and carefully follow the others; you will then seldom have occasion for regret. Thus, being seldom mistaken in your utterances, and having few occasions for regret in the line you take, you are on the high road to your preferment."
</div>
<p>Duke Ngai asked him what should be done to render the people submissive to authority, Confucius replied:</p>
<div class="left conf">
Promote the straightforward, and reject those whose courses are crooked, and the thing will be effected. Promote the crooked and reject the straightforward, and the effect will be the reverse." 
</div>
<p>Ki K&rsquo;ang asked of him how the people could be induced to show respect, loyalty, and willingness to be led, the Master answered:</p>
<div class="left conf">
Let there be grave dignity in him who has the oversight of them, and they will show him respect; let him be seen to be good to his own parents, and kindly in disposition, and they will be loyal to him; let him promote those who have ability, and see to the instruction of those who have it not, and they will be willing to be led."
</div>
<p>Someone asked why Confucius was not an administrator of government to which he replied:</p>
<div class="left conf">
What says the 'Book of the Annals,' with reference to filial duty? 'Make it a point to be dutiful to your parents and amicable with your brethren; the same duties extend to an administrator.' If these, then, also make an administrator, how am I to take your words about being an administrator?" 
</div>
<p>On one occasion the Master remarked:</p>
<div class="left conf">
I know not what men are good for, on whose word no reliance can be placed. How should your carriages, large or little, get along without your whipple-trees or swing-trees?" 
</div>
<p>Tsz-chang asked if it were possible to forecast the state of the country ten generations hence. The Master replied:</p>
<div class="left conf">
The Yin dynasty adopted the rules and manners of the Hi line of kings, and it is possible to tell whether it retrograded or advanced. The Chow line has followed the Yin, adopting its ways, and whether there has been deterioration or improvement may also be determined. Some other line may take up in turn those of Chow; and supposing even this process to go on for a hundred generations, the result may be known." 
</div>
<div class="left conf">
It is but flattery to make sacrificial offerings to departed spirits not belonging to one's own family. "It is moral cowardice to leave undone what one perceives to be right to do." 
</div>

<p>[Footnote 3: Head of one of the &ldquo;Three Families&rdquo; of Lu.]</p>
