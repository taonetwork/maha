          <p>When he was in waiting, and at a meal with the prince, the prince would make the offering,and he (the Master) was the pregustator.</p>
<p>When sick and the prince came to see him, he would arrange his position so that his head inclined towards the east.
He would put over him his Court robes, and draw his girdle across them.
When summoned by order of the prince, he would start off without waiting for his horses to be put to.</p>
<p>On his entry into the Grand Temple, he inquired about everything connected with its usages.</p>
<p>If a friend died, and there were no near relatives to take him to, he would say, &ldquo;Let him be buried from my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a friend&rsquo;s gift�unless it consisted of meat that had been offered in sacrifice�he would not bow, even if it were a carriage and horses.</p>
<p>In sleep, he did not lie like one dead.</p>
<p>In his home life, he was not formal. Whenever he met with a person in mourning, even though it were a familiar acquaintance, he would be certain to change his manner.</p>
<p>When he met with any one in full-dress cap, or with any blind person, he would also unfailingly put on a different look, even though he were himself in undress at the time.</p>
<p>In saluting any person wearing mourning he would bow forwards towards the front bar of his carriage; in the same manner he would also salute the bearer of a census-register. When a sumptuous banquet was spread before him, a different expression would be sure to appear in his features, and he would rise up from his seat.</p>
<p>At a sudden thunder-clap, or when the wind grew furious, his look would also invariably be changed.</p>
<p>On getting into his car, he would never fail (first) to stand up erect, holding on by the strap. When in the car, he would never look about, nor speak hastily, nor bring one hand to the other.</p>
<div class="left conf">
Let one but make a movement in his face, And the bird will rise and seek some safer place. Here is a hen-pheasant from Shan Liang�and in season! and in season!" 
</div>
<p>After Tsz-lu had got it prepared, he smelt it thrice, and then rose up from his seat.</p>
<p>Footnote 22: Because, it is said, such colors were adopted in fasting and mourning.] [Footnote 23: Because they did not belong to the five correct colors (viz. green, yellow, carnation, white, and black), and were affected more by females.]
Footnote 24: Since white was, as it is still, the mourning color.] [Footnote 25: The act of &ldquo;grace,&rdquo; before eating.]</p>
