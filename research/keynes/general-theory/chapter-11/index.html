          <p>When a man makes an investment, he buys the right to prospective returns.</p>
<p>I call this &ldquo;the prospective yield of the investment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This prospective yield has a supply price which is the cost to create that investment.</p>
<p>This supply price is not the market price at which it is bought.
The relation between the prospective yield and its supply price gives us its marginal efficiency of capital.
It is equal to that rate of discount which would make the present value of the series of annuities given by the returns expected from the capital-asset during its life just equal to its supply price.
It is the expectation of yield and of the current supply price of the investment.
It is not based on the historical result of what an investment has yielded.
This marginal efficiencies for each kind of investment.
The greatest of these marginal efficiencies can then be regarded as the marginal efficiency of capital in general.</p>
<p>If more people buy ann investment over time, the marginal efficiency of that kind of investment will diminish.</p>
<p>This is:
because the prospective yield will fall as the supply of that type of capital is increased, and
This is takes place in the long run
partly because as a rule, pressure on the facilities for producing that type of capital will cause its supply price to increase.
This is takes place in the short run</p>
<p>Thus for each type of capital we can build up a schedule</p>
<p>We show how much investment in it will have to increase within the period, for its marginal efficiency to fall.
We then aggregate these curves for all types of capital to create a curve.
This will show the rate of aggregate investment to the corresponding general marginal efficiency of capital established by that rate of investment.</p>
<p>The actual rate of current investment will then be reduced to the point where there is no longer any investment which has the marginal efficiency to exceed the current rate of interest.</p>
<p>The rate of investment will be pushed to the point on the investment demand curve where its prospective returns are equal to the market rate of interest.</p>
<p>The demand price of the investment at equilibrium = Summation of the prospective yield from an asset at given timespan multiplied by the Present value of £1 deferred at that timespan at the current rate of interest.</p>
<p>Investment will be carried to the point where the demand price of the investment becomes equal to the supply price of the investment.
If the demand price of the investment falls goes below the supply price, investment will stop.</p>
<p>It follows that the inducement to invest depends partly on the investment demand-curve and partly on the rate of interest.</p>
<p>The conclusion of Book 4 has a comprehensive view of the factors determining the rate of investment in their actual complexity.
Neither the knowledge of an asset’s prospective yield nor the knowledge of the returns of the investment enables us to deduce either the rate of interest or the present value of the asset.
We must ascertain the rate of interest from some other source.
Only then can we value the asset by “capitalising” its prospective yield.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>The Marginal Productivity or Yield or Efficiency or Utility of Capital are familiar terms.</p>
<p>There are at least three ambiguities to clear up.</p>
<p>Ambiguity 1:</p>
<p>Are we concerned with the increment of physical product per unit of time due to the employment of a unit of capital?&lt;
This involves impossible difficulties as to the definition of the physical unit of capital.
We could say that 10 labourers will raise more wheat if they had more machines.
But I don&rsquo;t know how to reduce this to an arithmetical ratio which does not bring in values.
Or are we concerned with the increment of value due to the employment of one more value unit of capital? [quantity vs quality]</p>
<p>Ambiguity 2:</p>
<p>Are return on invesments some absolute quantity? Or is it a ratio?
It should be a ration since it is relative to the rate of interest.
Yet it is not usually made clear what the two terms of the ratio should be.</p>
<p>Ambiguity 3:</p>
<p>There is the distinction between the increment of value obtainable by using an additional quantity of capital in the existing situation, and the series of increments which it is expected to obtain over its lifetime.
That is, the distinction between Q1 and the complete series Q1, Q2..
This leads to the idea of expectation in economic theory.
Most discussions of the return on investment pay no attention to any member of the series except Q1.
Yet this can only be legitimate in a static theory where all Q&rsquo;s are equal.
The ordinary theory of distribution assumes that capital is now getting its marginal productivity (in some sense or other).
This is only valid in a stationary state.
The aggregate current return on investments has no direct relationship to the return on investment while its current return, at the time when the investment was theorized, is its cost to the investment seller.
The theorized return created by the investment seller also has no close connection with its actual return [proven by crashes].
There is a remarkable lack of any clear account of the matter.</p>
<p>Marshall uses the term “marginal net efficiency” of a factor of production or alternatively the “marginal utility of capital”.</p>
<p>A factory adds £100 worth of machinery to add £3 net output.
If this is the most optimum investment at equilibrium, then it means that the yearly rate of interest is 3%.
But this is indicates a part of the many causes which govern value.
They cannot be made into a theory of interest, any more than into a theory of wages, without reasoning in a circle.
If the rate of interest is 3% and hat-making absorbs £1m.
It means that hat-making will be able to turn the £1m into a value of over £1.03m.
This is why the investors paid 3% to get that £1m to put into hat-making.
If the rate is 20%, then less hat-making machinery would be bought that if the rate were 6% or 4%.
Thus, if the rate is 3% and hat-making absorbs capital then it means that the marginal utility of the hat-making machinery is at 3%.</p>
<p>Marshall was aware that we are involved in a circular argument if we try to determine what the rate of interest actually is.</p>
<p>[2] He accepts that the rate of interest determines the point to which new investment will be pushed, given the return-on-investment curve.
If the rate of interest is at 3%, then no one will pay £100 for a machine unless he hopes thereby to add £3 to his annual net output.
But Chapter 14 shows that in other passages Marshall was less cautious — though still drawing back when his argument was leading him on to dubious ground.</p>
<p>Professor Irving Fisher does not call it the “marginal efficiency of capital”.</p>
<p>He has an equal term as “the rate of return over cost” in his Theory of Interest (1930).
He writes that:
it is the rate which, employed in computing the present worth of all the costs and the present worth of all the returns, will make these two equal,
the extent of investment in any direction will depend on a comparison between the rate of return over cost and the rate of interest, and
to induce new investment “the rate of return over cost must exceed the rate of interest
this new magnitude (or factor) in our study plays the central role on the investment opportunity side of interest theory.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>The most important confusion on nthe meaning of the marginal efficiency of capital is due to the failure to see that it depends on the prospective yield of capital and not its current yield.</p>
<p>This is best illustrated by pointing out the effect on the marginal efficiency of capital of an expectation of changes in the prospective cost of production, whether these changes are expected to come from changes in labour cost or from inventions and new technique.</p>
<p>The output from today&rsquo;s new equipment must compete with the output from future, more-efficient, lower-cost equipment.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur’s money-profit from equipment, old or new, will be reduced if all output comes to be produced more cheaply.
Thus, the marginal efficiency of capital produced to-day is appropriately reduced.</p>
<p>Thus, the expectation of changes in the value of money influences the volume of current output.</p>
<p>The expectation of a fall in the value of money stimulates investment hence employment generally because it raises the investment demand-curve.
The expectation of a rise in the value of money reduces investment because it lowers the investment demand-curve.</p>
<p>This is what is behind Professor Irving Fisher’s theory of “Appreciation and Interest”</p>
<p>The distinction between the money rate of interest and the real rate of interest where the real rate of interest is equal to the money rate of interest after correction for changes in the value of money.
It is difficult to make sense of this theory because it is not clear whether the change in the value of money is or is not assumed to be foreseen.
If it is not foreseen, then there will be no effect on current affairs.
If it is foreseen, then the prices of existing goods will be forthwith so adjusted.
The advantages of holding money and of holding goods will become again equalised.
It will then be too late for holders of money to gain or to suffer a change in the rate of interest which will offset the prospective change during the period of the loan in the value of the money lent.</p>
<p>Professor Pigou’s solution is to suppose that the prospective change in the value of money is foreseen by one set of people but not foreseen by another.</p>
<p>This does not escape the dilemma.</p>
<p>The mistake lies in supposing that it is the rate of interest on which prospective changes in the value of money will directly react, instead of the marginal efficiency of a given stock of capital.</p>
<p>The prices of existing assets will always adjust themselves to changes in expectation concerning the prospective value of money.
The significance of such changes in expectation lies in their effect on the readiness to produce new assets through their reaction on the marginal efficiency of capital.
The stimulating effect of the expectation of higher prices is due, not to its raising the rate of interest (that would be a paradoxical way of stimulating output — in so far as the rate of interest rises, the stimulating effect is to that extent offset), but to its raising the marginal efficiency of a given stock of capital.
If the rate of interest were to rise pari passu with the marginal efficiency of capital, there would be no stimulating effect from the expectation of rising prices.
For the stimulus to output depends on the marginal efficiency of a given stock of capital rising relatively to the rate of interest.
Professor Fisher’s theory could be best re-written in terms of a “real rate of interest” defined as being the rate of interest which would have to rule, consequently on a change in the state of expectation as to the future value of money, in order that this change should have no effect on current output.[6]</p>
<p>An expectation of a future fall in the rate of interest will have the effect of lowering the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital.</p>
<p>Since it means that the output from equipment produced to-day will have to compete during part of its life with the output from equipment which is content with a lower return.
This expectation will have no great depressing effect, since the expectations, which are held concerning the complex of rates of interest for various terms which will rule in the future, will be partially reflected in the complex of rates of interest which rule to-day. Nevertheless there may be some depressing effect, since the output from equipment produced to-day, which will emerge towards the end of the life of this equipment, may have to compete with the output of much younger equipment which is content with a lower return because of the lower rate of interest which rules for periods subsequent to the end of the life of equipment produced to-day.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the dependence of the marginal efficiency of a given stock of capital on changes in expectation, because it is chiefly this dependence which renders the marginal efficiency of capital subject to the somewhat violent fluctuations which are the explanation of the Trade Cycle.</p>
<p>In Chapter 22 below we shall show that the succession of Boom and Slump can be described and analysed in terms of the fluctuations of the marginal efficiency of capital relatively to the rate of interest.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Two types of risk affect the volume of investment which have not commonly been distinguished, but which it is important to distinguish.</p>
<p>The first is the entrepreneur’s or borrower’s risk and arises out of doubts in his own mind as to the probability of his actually earning the prospective yield for which he hopes.
If a man is venturing his own money, this is the only risk which is relevant.</p>
<p>But where a system of borrowing and lending exists, by which I mean the granting of loans with a margin of real or personal security, a second type of risk is relevant which we may call the lender’s risk.</p>
<p>This may be due either to moral hazard, i.e. voluntary default or other means of escape, possibly lawful, from the fulfilment of the obligation, or to the possible insufficiency of the margin of security, i.e. involuntary default due to the disappointment of expectation.
A third source of risk might be added, namely, a possible adverse change in the value of the monetary standard which renders a money-loan to this extent less secure than a real asset; though all or most of this should be already reflected, and therefore absorbed, in the price of durable real assets.</p>
<p>Now the first type of risk is, in a sense, a real social cost, though susceptible to diminution by averaging as well as by an increased accuracy of foresight.</p>
<p>The second, however, is a pure addition to the cost of investment which would not exist if the borrower and lender were the same person.
Moreover, it involves in part a duplication of a proportion of the entrepreneur’s risk, which is added twice to the pure rate of interest to give the minimum prospective yield which will induce the investment.
For if a venture is a risky one, the borrower will require a wider margin between his expectation of yield and the rate of interest at which he will think it worth his while to borrow.
whilst the very same reason will lead the lender to require a wider margin between what he charges and the pure rate of interest in order to induce him to lend (except where the borrower is so strong and wealthy that he is in a position to offer an exceptional margin of security).
The hope of a very favourable outcome, which may balance the risk in the mind of the borrower, is not available to solace the lender.</p>
<p>This duplication of allowance for a portion of the risk has not hitherto been emphasised, so far as I am aware; but it may be important in certain circumstances. During a boom the popular estimation of the magnitude of both these risks, both borrower’s risk and lender’s risk, is apt to become unusually and imprudently low.
5</p>
<p>The marginal efficiency of capital curve is of fundamental importance because it is mainly through this factor (much more than through the rate of interest) that the expectation of the future influences the present.</p>
<p>The mistake of regarding the marginal efficiency of capital primarily in terms of the current yield of capital equipment, which would be correct only in the static state where there is no changing future to influence the present, has had the result of breaking the theoretical link between to-day and to-morrow.</p>
<p>Even the rate of interest is, virtually,[7] a current phenomenon.</p>
<p>If we reduce the marginal efficiency of capital to the same status, we cut ourselves off from taking any direct account of the influence of the future in our analysis of the existing equilibrium.</p>
<p>The fact that the assumptions of the static state often underlie present-day economic theory, imports into it a large element of unreality.</p>
<p>But the introduction of the concepts of user cost and of the marginal efficiency of capital, as defined above, will have the effect, I think, of bringing it back to reality, whilst reducing to a minimum the necessary degree of adaptation.</p>
<p>Economic future is linked to the present because of the durability of equipment.</p>
<p>It is, therefore agreeable to our broad principles that the expectation of the future should affect the present through the demand price for durable equipment.</p>

<li>For the sake of simplicity of statement I have slurred the point that we are dealing with complexes of rates of interest and discount corresponding to the different lengths of time which will elapse before the various prospective returns from the asset are realised. But it is not difficult to re-state the argument so as to cover this point. 2. But was he not wrong in supposing that the marginal productivity theory of wages is equally circular? 3.

Not completely; for its value partly reflects the uncertainty of the future. Moreover, the relation between rates of interest for different terms depends on expectations.
