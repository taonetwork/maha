          <!-- Thus the rate of interest at any time is the reward for parting with liquidity. -->
<p>Chapter 11 shows that there are forces causing the rate of investment to rise or fall so as to keep the rate of return on investments equal to the rate of interest.</p>
<p>Yet the rate of return on investments is, in itself, a different thing from the rate of interest.</p>
<p>The investment-demand curve governs how loanable funds are turned to new investment.</p>
<p>The rate of interest governs how funds are being currently supplied.
What determines the rate of interest?</p>
<p>The answers are in Chapter 14 and its Appendix.</p>
<p>They make the rate of interest depend on the interaction of the investment-demand curve with the psychological propensity to save.</p>
<p>The rate of interest is the balancing factor that converts the demand for saving into new investment forthcoming at a given rate of interest, equal with the supply of saving which results at that rate of interest from the community’s psychological propensity to save.</p>
<p>But this breaks down as soon as we perceive that it is impossible to deduce the rate of interest merely from a knowledge of the supply and demand for savings.</p>
<p>What, then, is our own answer to this question?</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The psychological time-preferences of an individual need two sets of decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The time-preference which I call the &ldquo;propensity to consume&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This determines for each individual how much of his income he will consume and save.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>His liquidity preference</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>How long does he intend to have his money savings and not spend it?</p>
<p>The mistake of previous theories on the rate of interest is that they neglect the liquidity preference.</p>
<p>This neglect is what we are repairing.</p>
<p>The rate of interest cannot be a return to saving or waiting as such.</p>
<p>If a man hoards his savings in cash, he earns no interest, though he saves just as much as before.
On the contrary, the definition of the rate of interest means that the rate of interest is the reward for parting with liquidity for a specified period.
For the rate of interest is, in itself, nothing more than the inverse proportion between a sum of money and what can be obtained for parting with control over the money in exchange for a debt[1] for a stated period of time.[2]</p>
<p>Thus the rate of interest at any time is the reward for parting with liquidity.</p>
<p>It is a measure of the unwillingness of those who have money to part with their liquid control over it.
The rate of interest is not the “price” which brings into equilibrium the demand savings with the readiness to create savings.
It is the “price” which equilibrates the desire to hold wealth in the form of cash with the available quantity of cash.
This implies that if the rate of interest were lower, i.e. if the reward for parting with cash were reduced, the amount of cash which the public would wish to hold would exceed the available supply.
If the rate of interest were raised, there would be a surplus of cash in the banks</p>
<p>Thus, the ratio of the amount of money and the liquidity-preference determines the actual rate of interest in given circumstances.</p>
<p>Liquidity-preference is a potentiality which determines the amount of money that the public will hold when the rate of interest is given.
So that if r is the rate of interest, M the quantity of money and L the function of liquidity-preference, we have M = L(r). This is how the quantity of money enters into the economic scheme.</p>
<p>Why does liquidity-preference exist?</p>
<p>We can use the ancient distinction for the use of money as:
a tool of trade, and
This makes it worthwhile to sacrifice a certain amount of interest for the convenience of liquidity.
But the rate of interest is never negative.
Why should anyone prefer to hold his wealth in a form that yields no interest to holding it in a form that yields interest?
A full explanation is complex and is in Chapter 15.
a store of wealth.</p>
<p>There is, however, a necessary condition failing which the existence of a liquidity-preference for money as a means of holding wealth could not exist.</p>
<p>The existence of the uncertainty of the future of the rate of interest.
If all future rates of interest could be foreseen, then all future rates of interest could be inferred from the present rates of interest for debts of different maturities.
The present rates would then be adjusted to the knowledge of the future rates.
For example, if 1dr is the value in the present year 1 of £1 deferred r years, and it is known that ndr will be the value in the year n of £1 deferred r years from that date, we have:
ndr = ndn+r / 1dn</p>
<p>It follows that the rate at which any debt can be turned into cash n years is given by two out of the complex of current rates of interest.</p>
<p>If the current rate of interest is positive for debts of every maturity, it would always be more advantageous to get into debt than to hold cash as a store of wealth.
If, on the contrary, the future rate of interest is uncertain, we cannot safely infer that ndr will be equal to 1dn+r / 1dn when the time comes.
If a need for cash arises before the expiry of n years, there is a risk of a loss being incurred in buying a long-term debt and subsequently turning it into cash, as compared with holding cash.
The actuarial profit or mathematical expectation of gain calculated in accordance with the existing probabilities — if it can be so calculated, which is doubtful — must be enough to compensate for the risk of disappointment.</p>
<p>There is, moreover, a further ground for liquidity-preference which results from the existence of uncertainty as to the future of the rate of interest, provided that there is an organised market for dealing in debts.</p>
<p>This is because different people will estimate the prospects differently.
Anyone who differs from the predominant opinion expressed in market quotations might keeping cash in order to profit, if he is right, from its turning out in due course that the 1dr’s were in a mistaken relationship to one another.[3]</p>
<p>This is closely analogous to what we have already discussed at some length in connection with the marginal efficiency of capital.</p>
<p>The marginal efficiency of capital is fixed not by the “best” opinion, but by the market valuation as determined by mass psychology.
Thus the expectations of the future of the rate of interest as fixed by mass psychology have their reactions on liquidity-preference.</p>
<p>Those betting on cash and those betting against cash creates a balance as the market price.</p>
<p>The three divisions of liquidity-preference depend on
the transactions-motive, i.e. the need of cash
the precautionary-motive as the desire for security as to the future cash equivalent
the speculative-motive, i.e. the object of securing profit from knowing better than the market what will the future be
The desirability of having a highly organised market for dealing with debts presents us with a dilemma.
Without an organised market, liquidity-preference due to the precautionary-motive would be greatly increased.
Whereas the existence of an organised market gives an opportunity for wide fluctuations in liquidity-preference due to the speculative-motive.
If the need for cash and the need for security absorb a quantity of cash which is not very sensitive to changes in the rate of interest so that there is more money for speculators, then the rate of interest and the price of bonds have to be fixed at the level where speculators will prefer to hold cash (because they feel “bearish” of the future of bonds) and is exactly equal to the amount of cash available for speculation.
Thus each increase in the quantity of money must raise the price of bonds sufficiently to exceed the expectations of some “bull” and so influence him to sell his bond for cash and join the “bear” brigade.
If, however, there is a negligible demand for cash from speculators, an increase in the quantity of money will have to lower the rate of interest almost immediately, in whatever degree is needed to raise employment and the wage-unit sufficiently to cause the additional cash to be absorbed by the need for cash and security.</p>
<p>As a rule, the liquidity-preference curve relating the quantity of money to the rate of interest is given by a smooth curve which shows the rate of interest falling as the quantity of money is increased.</p>
<p>For there are several different causes all leading towards this result.</p>
<p>First, as the rate of interest falls, more money will be absorbed by liquidity-preferences due to the need for cash.</p>
<p>If the fall in the rate of interest increases the national income, the amount of money which it is convenient to keep for transactions will be increased proportionally to the increase in income.
At the same time, the cost of the convenience of plenty of ready cash in terms of loss of interest will be diminished.
Unless we measure liquidity-preference in terms of wage-units rather than of money, similar results follow if the increased employment from a fall in the rate of interest leads to an increase of wages, i.e. to an increase in the money value of the wage-unit.</p>
<p>Second, every fall in the rate of interest may increase the quantity of cash which certain individuals will wish to hold because they think about the future rate of interest differently from the market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even a large increase in the quantity of money may exert a comparatively small influence on the rate of interest.</p>
<p>A large increase in the quantity of money may cause so much uncertainty that liquidity-preferences due to the need for security may be strengthened.
Opinion about the future of the rate of interest may also be so unanimous that a small change in present rates may cause a mass movement into cash.
The stability of the system is so dependent on the variety of opinion about what is uncertain.
If we are to control the economic system by changing the quantity of money, it is important that opinions should differ.
Thus this method of control is more precarious in the United States, where everyone tends to hold the same opinion at the same time, than in England where differences of opinion are more usual.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>If we assert that money is the drink which stimulates the system to activity, there may be several slips between the cup and the lip.</p>
<p>An increase in the quantity of money might reduce the rate of interest.
But this will not happen if the public&rsquo;s liquidity-preferences are increasing more than the quantity of money.
A decline in the rate of interest might increase the volume of investment.
But this will not happen if the returns on investment are falling faster than the interest rate.
An increase in the volume of investment may be expected to increase employment.
But this may not happen if the propensity to consume is falling.</p>
<p>Finally, if employment increases, prices will rise Inflation will then increase the quantity of money needed to maintain a given rate of interest. And when output has increased and prices have risen, the effect of this on liquidity-preference will be to increase the .
4</p>
<p>Whilst liquidity-preference due to the speculative-motive corresponds to what in my Treatise on Money I called “the state of bearishness”, it is by no means the same thing. For “bearishness” is there defined as the functional-relationship, not between the rate of interest (or price of debts) and the quantity of money, but between the price of assets and debts, taken together, and the quantity of money. This treatment, however, involved a confusion between results due to a change in the rate of interest and those due to a change in the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, which I hope I have here avoided.
5</p>
<p>The concept of Hoarding may be regarded as a first approximation to the concept of Liquidity-preference.</p>
<p>Indeed if we were to substitute “propensity to hoard” for “hoarding”, it would come to substantially the same thing.
But if we mean by “hoarding” an actual increase in cash-holding, it is an incomplete idea — and seriously misleading if it causes us to think of “hoarding” and “not-hoarding” as simple alternatives.
For the decision to hoard is not taken absolutely or without regard to the advantages offered for parting with liquidity.
It results from a balancing of advantages, and we have, therefore, to know what lies in the other scale.
Moreover it is impossible for the actual amount of hoarding to change as a result of decisions on the part of the public, so long as we mean by “hoarding” the actual holding of cash.
For the amount of hoarding must be equal to the quantity of money (or — on some definitions — to the quantity of money minus what is required to satisfy the transactions-motive).
The quantity of money is not determined by the public.
All that the propensity of the public towards hoarding can achieve is to determine the rate of interest at which the aggregate desire to hoard becomes equal to the available cash.
The habit of overlooking the relation of the rate of interest to hoarding may be a part of the explanation why interest has been usually regarded as the reward of not-spending, whereas in fact it is, the reward of not-hoarding.</p>

<li>Without disturbance to this definition, we can draw the line between “money” and “debts” at whatever point is most convenient for handling a particular problem. For example, we can treat as money any command over general purchasing power which the owner has not parted with for a period in excess of three months, and as debt what cannot be recovered for a longer period than this; or we can substitute for “three months” one month or three days or three hours or any other period; or we can exclude from money whatever is not legal tender on the spot. It is often convenient in practice to include in money time-deposits with banks and, occasionally, even such instruments as (e.g.) treasury bills. As a rule, I shall, as in my Treatise on Money, assume that money is coextensive with bank deposits. 2. In general discussion, as distinct from specific problems where the period of the debt is expressly specified, it is convenient to mean by the rate of interest the complex of the various rates of interest current for different periods of time, i.e. for debts of different maturities. 3. This is the same point as I discussed in my Treatise on Money under the designation of the two views and the “bull-bear” position. 4. It might be thought that, in the same way, an individual, who believed that the prospective yield of investments will be below what the market is expecting, will have a sufficient reason for holding liquid cash. But this is not the case. He has a sufficient reason for holding cash or debts in preference to equities; but the purchase of debts will be a preferable alternative to holding cash, unless he also believes that the future rate of interest will prove to be higher than the market is supposing.
