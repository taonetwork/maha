              <h2 style="margin: 0 !important;">Harmonies of the World</h2>
                          
            
              <small>January 6, 2020</small>
                          
          </header>

                

          <p>Book 2 explained:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the regular plane figures are fitted together to form solids</li>
<li>the five regular solids, among others, on account of the plane figures.</li>
<li>why the Platonists designated 5 as the figures of the world</li>
<li>what element any solid was compared on account of what property.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will now explain these figures by themselves and not on account of the planes, as much as suffices for the celestial harmonies.</p>
<p>The rest is in the Epitome of Astronomy, Volume 2, Book 4</p>
<p>Accordingly, from the Mysterium Cosmographicum, of the five solids in the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>three are primary</li>
<li>two secondary</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Cube</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the outmost and the most spacious, because firstborn and having the nature [rationem] of a whole, in the very form of its generation.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Tetrahedron [pyramid]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows the cube, as a part of a cut-up cube. Nevertheless, it is primary too, with a solid trilinear angle, like the cube.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Dodecahedron [pentagons]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is within the tetrahedron. It is the last of primary figures, namely, like a solid composed of parts of a cube and similar parts of a tetrahedron, i.e., of irregular tetrahedrons, wherewith the cube inside is roofed over.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Icosahedron [triangles]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <!-- similar , --> the last of the secondary figures. It has a plurilinear solid angle.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Octahedron [triangles]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is innermost, which is similar to the cube. It is the first of the secondary figures and to which as inscriptile the first place is due, just as the first outside place is due to the cube as circumscribable. <!-- first outside place is due to the cube as circumscriptile. --></p>
<p>However, there are as it were two noteworthy weddings of these figures, made from different classes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. Males or Primary</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>cube</li>
<li>dodecahedron</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>B. Females or secondary</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>octahedron</li>
<li>icosahedron</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>C. Bachelors or Hermaphrodite</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>tetrahedron</li>
</ul>
<p>This is inscribed in itself, just as those female solids are inscribed in the males and are as it were subject to them, and have the signs of the feminine sex, opposite the masculine, namely, angles opposite planes.</p>
<p>The tetrahedron is the element, bowels, and rib of the male cube.</p>
<p>The feminine octahedron is the element and part of the tetrahedron in another way. Thus, the tetrahedron mediates in this marriage.</p>
<p>The main difference in these wedlocks or family relationships is that the ratio of the cube is rational.</p>
<p>This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>the tetrahedron is 1/3 of the body of the cube</li>
<li>the octahedron is 1/2 of the tetrahedron and 1/6 of the cube; while the ratio of the dodecahedron&rsquo;s wedding is irrational [ineffabilis] but divine.</li>
</ul>
<!-- The union of these two words commands the reader to be careful as to their significance. For t -->
<p>The word irrational here does not imply any nobility like in theology and divine things, but denotes an inferior condition. Book 1 said that there are many irrationals in geometry which do not participate in a divine proportion.</p>
<p>Book 1 has the divine ratio, or rather the divine section. For in other proportions there are four terms present; and three, in a continued proportion; but the divine requires a single relation of terms outside of that of the proportion itself, namely in such fashion that the two lesser terms, as parts make up the greater term, as a whole.</p>
<p>Therefore, as much as is taken away from this wedding of the dodecahedron on account of its employing an irrational proportion, is added to it conversely, because its irrationality approaches the divine.</p>
<p>This wedding also comprehends the solid star too, the generation whereof arises from the continuation of five planes of the dodecahedron till they all meet in a single point. See its generation in Book</p>
<p>Lastly, the ratio of the spheres circumscribed around them to those inscribed in them. In the case of the tetrahedron it is rational, 100,000 : 33,333 or 3 : 1.</p>
<p>In the wedding of the cube it is irrational, but the radius of the inscribed sphere is rational in square, and is itself the square root of 1/3 the square on the radius [of the circumscribed sphere], namely 100,000 : 57,735; in the wedding of the dodecahedron, clearly irrational, 100,000 : 79,465; in the case of the star, 100,000 : 52,573, half the side of the icosahedron or half the distance between two rays.</p>
