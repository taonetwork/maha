          <!-- I will not let you go now until you give the proofs which, in the presence of our friends, you undertook just now to give me. -->
<div class="left soc">
There are two sorts of people:
<ol>
<li>Those who spend large sums on money in building useless houses</li>
<li>Those who spend far less but furnish it with all they need.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is one of the essentials of economy.</p>
<p>Mirroring them are two other sets of persons: The first possessors of furniture of various kinds, which they cannot, however, lay their hands on when the need arises.</p>
<p>They hardly know if they have got all safe and sound or not: whereby they put themselves and their domestics to much mental torture. The others are perhaps less amply, or at any rate not more amply supplied, but they have everything ready at the instant for immediate use. This is because in the first case everything is thrown down where it chanced, whereas those others have everything arranged, each in its appointed place. This implies that everything is orderly arranged, not in the first chance place, but in that to which it naturally belongs.</p>
</div>
<div class="right ceph">
Yes, the case is to the point, I think, and does involve another economic principle.
</div>
<p>Soc. What, then, if I exhibit to you a third contrast, which bears on the condition of domestic slaves? On the one side you shall see them fettered hard and fast, and yet for ever breaking their chains and running away. On the other side the slaves are loosed, and free to move, but for all that, they choose to work, it seems; they are constant to their masters. I think you will admit that I here point out another function of economy (4) worth noting. Soc. Or take, again, the instance of two farmers engaged in cultivating farms (5) as like as possible. The one had never done asserting that agriculture has been his ruin, and is in the depth of despair; the other has all he needs in abundance and of the best, and how acquired?—by this same agriculture. Yes (Critobulus answered), to be sure; perhaps (6) the former spends both toil and money not simply on what he needs, but on things which cause an injury to house alike and owner. (6) Or, &ldquo;like enough in the one case the money and pains are spent,&rdquo; etc. Soc. That is a possible case, no doubt, but it is not the one that I refer to; I mean people pretending they are farmers, and yet they have not a penny to expend on the real needs of their business. Soc. Yes, and while you contemplate, you must make trial of yourself and see if you have wit to understand. At present, I will bear you witness that if it is to go and see a party of players performing in a comedy, you will get up at cock-crow, and come trudging a long way, and ply me volubly with reasons why I should accompany you to see the play. But you have never once invited me to come and witness such an incident as those we were speaking of just now. Crit. And so I seem to you ridiculous? (7) (7) Or, &ldquo;a comic character in the performance.&rdquo; Soc. &ldquo;Not so comic as you must appear to yourself (i.e. with your keen sense of the ludicrous).&rdquo; Soc. Far more ridiculous to yourself, I warrant. But now let me point out to you another contrast: between certain people whose dealing with horses has brought them to the brink of poverty, and certain others who have found in the same pursuit the road to affluence, (8) and have a right besides to plume themselves upon their gains. (9) (8) Or, &ldquo;who have not only attained to affluence by the same pursuit, but can hold their heads high, and may well pride themselves on their thrift.&rdquo; (9) Cf. Hom. &ldquo;Il.&rdquo; xii. 114, {ippoisin kai okhesphin agallomenos}, et passim; &ldquo;Hiero,&rdquo; viii. 5; &ldquo;Anab.&rdquo; II. vi. 26. Crit. Well, then, I may tell you, I see and know both characters as well as you do; but I do not find myself a whit the more included among those who gain. Soc. Because you look at them just as you might at the actors in a tragedy or comedy, and with the same intent—your object being to delight the ear and charm the eye, but not, I take it, to become yourself a poet. And there you are right enough, no doubt, since you have no desire to become a playright. But, when circumstances compel you to concern yourself with horsemanship, does it not seem to you a little foolish not to consider how you are to escape being a mere amateur in the matter, especially as the same creatures which are good for use are profitable for sale? Crit. So you wish me to set up as a breeder of young horses, (10) do you, Socrates? (10) See &ldquo;Horsemanship,&rdquo; ii. 1. Soc. Not so, no more than I would recommend you to purchase lads and train them up from boyhood as farm-labourers. But in my opinion there is a certain happy moment of growth which must be seized, alike in man and horse, rich in present service and in future promise. In further illustration, I can show you how some men treat their wedded wives in such a way that they find in them true helpmates to the joint increase of their estate, while others treat them in a way to bring upon themselves wholesale disaster. (11) (11) Reading {e os pleista}, al. {e oi pleistoi} = &ldquo;to bring about disaster in most cases.&rdquo; Crit. Ought the husband or the wife to bear the blame of that? Soc. If it goes ill with the sheep we blame the shepherd, as a rule, or if a horse shows vice we throw the blame in general upon the rider. But in the case of women, supposing the wife to have received instruction from her husband and yet she delights in wrong-doing, (12) it may be that the wife is justly held to blame; but supposing he has never tried to teach her the first principles of &ldquo;fair and noble&rdquo; conduct, (13) and finds her quite an ignoramus (14) in these matters, surely the husband will be justly held to blame. But come now (he added), we are all friends here; make a clean breast of it, and tell us, Critobulus, the plain unvarnished truth: Is there an one to whom you are more in the habit of entrusting matters of importance than to your wife? (12) Cf. &ldquo;Horsemanship,&rdquo; vi. 5, of a horse &ldquo;to show vice.&rdquo; (13) Or, &ldquo;things beautiful and of good report.&rdquo; (14) Al. &ldquo;has treated her as a dunce, devoid of this high knowledge.&rdquo; Crit. There is no one. Soc. And is there any one with whom you are less in the habit of conversing than with your wife? Crit. Not many, I am forced to admit. Soc. And when you married her she was quite young, a mere girl—at an age when, as far as seeing and hearing go, she had the smallest acquaintance with the outer world? Crit. Certainly. Soc. Then would it not be more astonishing that she should have real knowledge how to speak and act than that she should go altogether astray? Crit. But let me ask you a question, Socrates: have those happy husbands, you tell us of, who are blessed with good wives educated them themselves? Soc. There is nothing like investigation. I will introduce you to Aspasia, (15) who will explain these matters to you in a far more scientific way than I can. My belief is that a good wife, being as she is the partner in a common estate, must needs be her husband&rsquo;s counterpoise and counterpart for good; since, if it is through the transactions of the husband, as a rule, that goods of all sorts find their way into the house, yet it is by means of the wife&rsquo;s economy and thrift that the greater part of the expenditure is checked, and on the successful issue or the mishandling of the same depends the increase or impoverishment of a whole estate. And so with regard to the remaining arts and sciences, I think I can point out to you the ablest performers in each case, if you feel you have any further need of help. (16) (15) Aspasia. See &ldquo;Mem.&rdquo; II. vi. 36. (16) Al. &ldquo;there are successful performers in each who will be happy to illustrate any point in which you think you need,&rdquo; etc. IV But why need you illustrate all the sciences, Socrates? (Critobulus asked): it would not be very easy to discover efficient craftsmen of all the arts, and quite impossible to become skilled in all one&rsquo;s self. So, please, confine yourself to the nobler branches of knowledge as men regard them, such as it will best befit me to pursue with devotion; be so good as to point me out these and their performers, and, above all, contribute as far as in you lies the aid of your own personal instruction. Soc. A good suggestion, Critobulus, for the base mechanic arts, so called, have got a bad name; and what is more, are held in ill repute by civilised communities, and not unreasonably; seeing they are the ruin of the bodies of all concerned in them, workers and overseers alike, who are forced to remain in sitting postures and to hug the loom, or else to crouch whole days confronting a furnace. Hand in hand with physical enervation follows apace enfeeblement of soul: while the demand which these base mechanic arts makes on the time of those employed in them leaves them no leisure to devote to the claims of friendship and the state. How can such folk be other than sorry friends and ill defenders of the fatherland? So much so that in some states, especially those reputed to be warlike, no citizen (1) is allowed to exercise any mechanical craft at all. (1) &ldquo;In the strict sense,&rdquo; e.g. the Spartiates in Sparta. See &ldquo;Pol. Lac.&rdquo; vii.; Newman, op. cit. i. 99, 103 foll. Crit. Then which are the arts you would counsel us to engage in? Soc. Well, we shall not be ashamed, I hope, to imitate the kings of Persia? (2) That monarch, it is said, regards amongst the noblest and most necessary pursuits two in particular, which are the arts of husbandry and war, and in these two he takes the strongest interest. (2) &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t make us blush actually to take a leaf out of the great king&rsquo;s book.&rdquo; As to the Greek text at this point see the commentators, and also a note by Mr. H. Richers in the &ldquo;Classical Review,&rdquo; x. 102. What! (Critobulus exclaimed); do you, Socrates, really believe that the king of Persia pays a personal regard to husbandry, along with all his other cares? Soc. We have only to investigate the matter, Critobulus, and I daresay we shall discover whether this is so or not. We are agreed that he takes strong interest in military matters; since, however numerous the tributary nations, there is a governor to each, and every governor has orders from the king what number of cavalry, archers, slingers and targeteers (3) it is his business to support, as adequate to control the subject population, or in case of hostile attack to defend the country. Apart from these the king keeps garrisons in all the citadels. The actual support of these devolves upon the governor, to whom the duty is assigned. The king himself meanwhile conducts the annual inspection and review of troops, both mercenary and other, that have orders to be under arms. These all are simultaneously assembled (with the exception of the garrisons of citadels) at the mustering ground, (4) so named. That portion of the army within access of the royal residence the king reviews in person; the remainder, living in remoter districts of the empire, he inspects by proxy, sending certain trusty representatives. (5) Wherever the commandants of garrisons, the captains of thousands, and the satraps (6) are seen to have their appointed members complete, and at the same time shall present their troops equipped with horse and arms in thorough efficiency, these officers the king delights to honour, and showers gifts upon them largely. But as to those officers whom he finds either to have neglected their garrisons, or to have made private gain of their position, these he heavily chastises, deposing them from office, and appointing other superintendents (7) in their stead. Such conduct, I think we may say, indisputably proves the interest which he takes in matters military. (3) Or, Gerrophoroi, &ldquo;wicker-shield bearers.&rdquo; (4) Or, &ldquo;rendezvous&rdquo;; &ldquo;the &lsquo;Champ de Mars&rsquo; for the nonce.&rdquo; Cf. &ldquo;Cyrop.&rdquo; VI. ii. 11. (5) Lit. &ldquo;he sends some of the faithful to inspect.&rdquo; Cf. our &ldquo;trusty and well-beloved.&rdquo; (6) See, for the system, Herod. iii. 89 foll.; &ldquo;Cyrop.&rdquo; VIII. vi. 11. (7) Or, as we say, &ldquo;inspecting officers.&rdquo; Cf. &ldquo;Cyrop.&rdquo; VIII. i. 9. Further than this, by means of a royal progress through the country, he has an opportunity of inspecting personally some portion of his territory, and again of visiting the remainder in proxy as above by trusty representatives; and wheresoever he perceives that any of his governors can present to him a district thickly populated, and the soil in a state of active cultivation, full of trees and fruits, its natural products, to such officers he adds other territory, adorning them with gifts and distinguishing them by seats of honour. But those officers whose land he sees lying idle and with but few inhabitants, owing either to the harshness of their government, their insolence, or their neglect, he punishes, and making them to cease from their office he appoints other rulers in their place&hellip;. Does not this conduct indicate at least as great an anxiety to promote the active cultivation of the land by its inhabitants as to provide for its defence by military occupation? (8) (8) Lit. &ldquo;by those who guard and garrison it.&rdquo; Moreover, the governors appointed to preside over these two departments of state are not one and the same. But one class governs the inhabitants proper including the workers of the soil, and collects the tribute from them, another is in command of the armed garrisons. If the commandant (9) protects the country insufficiently, the civil governor of the population, who is in charge also of the productive works, lodges accusation against the commandant to the effect that the inhabitants are prevented working through deficiency of protection. Or if again, in spite of peace being secured to the works of the land by the military governor, the civil authority still presents a territory sparse in population and untilled, it is the commandant&rsquo;s turn to accuse the civil ruler. For you may take it as a rule, a population tilling their territory badly will fail to support their garrisons and be quite unequal to paying their tribute. Where a satrap is appointed he has charge of both departments. (10) Thereupon Critobulus: Well, Socrates (said he), if such is his conduct, I admit that the great king does pay attention to agriculture no less than to military affairs. And besides all this (proceeded Socrates), nowhere among the various countries which he inhabits or visits does he fail to make it his first care that there shall be orchards and gardens, parks and &ldquo;paradises,&rdquo; as they are called, full of all fair and noble products which the earth brings forth; and within these chiefly he spends his days, when the season of the year permits. Crit. To be sure, Socrates, it is a natural and necessary conclusion that when the king himself spends so large a portion of his time there, his paradises should be furnished to perfection with trees and all else beautiful that earth brings forth. Soc. And some say, Critobulus, that when the king gives gifts, he summons in the first place those who have shown themselves brave warriors, since all the ploughing in the world were but small gain in the absence of those who should protect the fields; and next to these he summons those who have stocked their countries best and rendered them productive, on the principle that but for the tillers of the soil the warriors themselves could scarcely live. And there is a tale told of Cyrus, the most famous prince, I need not tell you, who ever wore a crown, (11) how on one occasion he said to those who had been called to receive the gifts, &ldquo;it were no injustice, if he himself received the gifts due to warriors and tillers of the soil alike,&rdquo; for &ldquo;did he not carry off the palm in stocking the country and also in protecting the goods with which it had been stocked?&rdquo; (11) Lit. &ldquo;the most glorious king that ever lived.&rdquo; The remark would seem to apply better to Cyrus the Great. Nitsche and others regard these SS. 18, 19 as interpolated. See Schenkl ad loc. Crit. Which clearly shows, Socrates, if the tale be true, that this same Cyrus took as great a pride in fostering the productive energies of his country and stocking it with good things, as in his reputation as a warrior.</p>
<div class="left soc">
Socrates: Yes indeed, had Cyrus lived, he would have been the best of rulers.
<pre><code>See what happened when he marched to do battle for the sovereignty of Persia with his brother.
Not one man deserted from Cyrus to the king, but from the king to Cyrus tens of thousands.
This would be a great testimony to a ruler's worth, that his followers follow him of their own free will, and when the moment of danger comes refuse to part from him.
The friends of Cyrus not only fought their battles side by side with him while he lived, but when he died they too died battling around his dead body, except only Ariaeus, who was absent at his post on the left wing of the army.
But there is another tale of this same Cyrus in connection with Lysander, who himself narrated it on one occasion to a friend of his in Megara.
</code></pre>
<p>Lysander, it seems, had gone with presents sent by the Allies to Cyrus, who entertained him, and amongst other marks of courtesy showed him his &ldquo;paradise&rdquo; at Sardis. Lysander was astonished at the beauty of the trees within, all planted (17) at equal intervals, the long straight rows of waving branches, the perfect regularity, the rectangular (18) symmetry of the whole, and the many sweet scents which hung about them as they paced the park. In admiration he exclaimed to Cyrus: &ldquo;All this beauty is marvellous enough, but what astonishes me still more is the talent of the artificer who mapped out and arranged for you the several parts of this fair scene.&rdquo; Cyrus was pleased by the remark, and said: &ldquo;Know then, Lysander, it is I who measured and arranged it all. Some of the trees,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I planted with my own hands.&rdquo; Then Lysander, regarding earnestly the speaker, when he saw the beauty of his apparel and perceived its fragrance, the splendour (20) also of the necklaces and armlets, and other ornaments which he wore, exclaimed: &ldquo;What say you, Cyrus? did you with your own hands plant some of these trees?&rdquo; whereat the other: &ldquo;Does that surprise you, Lysander? I swear to you by Mithres, (21) when in ordinary health I never dream of sitting down to supper without first practising some exercise of war or husbandry in the sweat of my brow, or venturing some strife of honour, as suits my mood.&rdquo; &quot; On hearing this,&quot; said Lysander to his friend, &ldquo;I could not help seizing him by the hand and exclaiming, &lsquo;Cyrus, you have indeed good right to be a happy man, (22) since you are happy in being a good man.'&rdquo;</p>
