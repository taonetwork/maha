      <title>Chapter 14: How the Exchange is a Constraint on despotic Power</title>

      <description>Moscow would have descended from its despotic power, but could not.
The establishment of commerce depended on that of the exchange, and the transactions were inconsistent with all its laws.
In 1745, the Czarina made a law to expel the Jews, because they remitted overseas the coin of those who were banished into Siberia, as well as the coin of the foreigners in her service.
All the subjects of the empire are slaves.</description>

      <title>Chapter 17: Public Debts</title>

      <description>SOME have imagined, that it was for the advantage of a state to be indebted to itself: they thought that this multiplied riches, by increasing the circulation.
Those who are of this opinion have, I believe, confounded a circulating paper which represents money, or a circulating paper which is the sign of the profits that a company has, or will make by commerce, with a paper which represents a debt. The two first are extremely advantageous to the state: the last can never be so: and all that we can expect from it is, that individuals have a good security from the government for their money.</description>

      <title>Chapter 3: Ideal [Nominal] Money</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/research/montesquieu/spirit-of-the-laws/book-22/chapter-3/</link>

      <description>THERE is both real and ideal money.
Civilized nations generally only use ideal money, because they have converted their real money into ideal.
Their real money was initially some metal of a certain weight and standard. But soon dishonesty or lack made them reduce that metal from money, but money retained the same name.
For example, they removed a half of the silver from a livre at a pound weight, but still called it a livre.</description>

      <title>Chapter 9: The relative Scarcity of Gold and Silver</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/research/montesquieu/spirit-of-the-laws/book-22/chapter-9/</link>

      <description>BESIDES the positive plenty and scarcity of gold and silver, there is still a relative abundance and a relative scarcity of one of these metals compared to the other.
The avaricious hoard up their gold and silver.
They do not care to spend. They are fond of signs that are not subject to decay. They prefer gold to silver, because as they are always afraid of losing, they can best conceal that which takes up the least room.</description>

      <description>THE relative abundance and scarcity of coin in different countries leads to the course of exchange. Exchange is a fixing of the actual and momentary value of coin.
Silver, as metal, has a value like all other merchandise.
 It has an additional value as it can be the sign of other merchandise If it were just a mere merchandise, it would lose much of its value.  Nominal value, Real value, and Relative value Silver, as coin, has a value, which the prince in some respects can fix, and in others he cannot.</description>

      <title>How the Emperors Devalued their Coin</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/research/montesquieu/spirit-of-the-laws/book-22/chapter-13/</link>

      <description>The Roman republic devalued their coin by adding alloys because of the unwise spending of their leaders. They even plated or covered cheap metals like copper with a thin plate of silver. This money is mentioned in the 77th book of Dio.
Didius Julian first began to debase it. The coin of Caracalla had an alloy of more than half. The coin of Alexander Severus had 2/3. The debasing increased until under Gallienus until the silver coin was merely copper silvered over.</description>

      <title>How the Price of Things is fixed in the Variation of the Sign of Riches</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/research/montesquieu/spirit-of-the-laws/book-22/chapter-7/</link>

      <description>MONEY is the price of merchandise or manufactures. But how shall we fix this price? By what piece of money is everything to be represented?
If we compare the mass of gold and silver in the whole world, with the quantity of merchandise in it, every merchandize may be compared to a portion of the entire mass of gold and silver. As the total of the one is to the total of the other, so part of the one will be to part of the other.</description>

      <title>Lending on Interest</title>

      <description>SPECIE is the sign of value. It is evident, that he who has occasion for this sign, ought to pay for the use of it, as well as for every thing else that he has occasion for. All the difference is, that other things may be either hired or bought; whilst money, which is the price of things, can only be hired, and not bought.*
To lend money without interest, is certainly an action laudable and extremely good; but it is obvious, that it is only a counsel of religion, and not a civil law.</description>

      <title>Why Interest was lowered one half after the Conquest of the Indies</title>

      <description>GARCILASSO informs us, that in Spain after the conquest of the Indies, interest fell from 10% to 5%.
The cause is that conquest bringing in a lot of money suddenly into Europe. Many persons got money and had a need for it. The price of all things increased, while the value of money diminished. The proportion was then broken, and all the old debts were discharged.
We may recollect the time of the system when every thing was at a high price except specie.</description>

      <title>Why we use Money</title>

      <description>The following people trade by exchange:
 savages who have few merchandise civilized nations who have only two or three species.  The caravans of Moors who go to Timbuktu, in the heart of Africa, do not need money.
They exchange their salt for gold. The Moor puts his salt in a heap. The Negro puts his gold dust in another. If there is not gold enough, the Moor takes away some of his salt, or the Negro adds more gold, until both parties are agreed.</description>

      <description>Our two successive ministers exerted much authority over our French coin. But this was vastly exceeded by the Romans after they conquered Italy and had war with the Carthaginians when they raised their coin:
 In the first Punic war their 12 ounces of copper weighed only 2 ounces. In the second Punic war, it was no more than 1 ounce.  A modern example is to take half the silver from a crown of fix livres, in order to:</description>
