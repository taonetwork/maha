          <p>THE first Greeks were all pirates.</p>
<p>Minos was a pirate who enjoyed the empire of his own isle. But when the Greeks became a great people, the Athenians obtained the real dominion of the sea; because this trading and victorious nation gave laws to the most potent monarch of that time; and humbled the maritime powers of Syria, of the isle of Cyprus, and Phœnicia.</p>
<p>Xenophon says “Athens rules the sea. But the country of Attica is joined to the continent and so it is ravaged by enemies when the Athenians are engaged in distant expeditions. Their leaders secure their wealth by sending it to some island. Their people have no lands but have no uneasiness as they enjoyed the empire of the sea. They would be able to annoy others, and at the same time be out of all danger of being annoyed.”</p>
<p>One would imagine, that Xenophon was speaking of England.</p>
<p>The Athenians had heads were filled with ambitious projects;</p>
<p>the Athenians, who augmented their jealousy, instead of increasing their influence; who were more attentive to extend their maritime empire than to enjoy it; whose political government was such, that the common people distributed the public revenues amongst themselves, while the rich were in a state of oppression; the Athenians, I say, did not carry on so extensive a commerce as might be expected from the produce of their mines, from the multitude of their slaves, from the number of their seamen, from their influence over the cities of Greece; and, above all, from the excellent institutions of Solon. Their trade was almost wholly confined to Greece, and to the Euxine sea; from whence they drew their subsistence.</p>
<p>Corinth had a good location. It separated two seas, and opened and shut the Peloponnesus. it was the key of Greece, and a city of the greatest importance, at a time when the people of Greece were a world, and the cities of Greece, nations. Its trade was more extensive than that of Athens, having a port to receive the merchandizes of Asia; and another those of Italy: for the great difficulties which attended the doubling cape Malea, where the&gt; * meeting of opposite winds causes shipwrecks, induced every one to go to Corinth, and they could even convey their vessels over land from one sea to the other. Never was there a city, in which the works of art were carried to so high a degree of perfection. But here religion finished the corruption, which their opulence began. They erected a temple to Venus, in which more than a thousand courtesans were consecrated to that deity; from this seminary came the   greatest part of those celebrated beauties, whose history Athenæus has presumed to commit to writing.</p>
<p>In Homer’s time, the opulence of Greece centered in Rhodes, Corinth, and Orchomenus.</p>
<p>He says: “Jupiter loved the Rhodians and made them a very wealthy nation.”
He calls Corinth as rich.
manner, when he speaks of cities that have plenty of gold, he mentions Orchomenus, to which he joins Thebes in Egypt.</p>
<p>Rhodes and Corinth preserved their power, but Orchomenus lost hers.</p>
<p>The situation of Orchomenus in the neighbourhood of the Hellespont, the Propontis, and the Euxine sea, makes us naturally imagine, that she was indebted for her opulence to a trade along that maritime coast, which had given rise to the fable of the golden fleece.</p>
<p>The name of Minyeios has been given to Orchomenus, as well as to the Argonauts.</p>
<p>But these seas becoming afterwards more frequented, the Greeks planted along the coasts a greater number of colonies, which traded with the barbarous nations, and at the same time preserved an intercourse with their mother country: in consequence of this, Orchomenus began to decline, till at length it was lost in the croud of the other cities of Greece.</p>
<p>Before Homer’s time, the Greeks had scarce any trade but among themselves, and with a few barbarous nations; in proportion, however, as they formed new colonies, they extended their dominion.</p>
<p>Greece was a large peninsula in a pretty compact country, with a large sea-coast with capes that seemed to have kept off the seas. Its gulfs opened on all sides to receive them.</p>
<p>Her innumerable colonies formed an immense circle round her and there she beheld, in some measure, the whole civilized world.</p>
<p>Did she penetrate into Sicily and Italy? she formed new nations.
Did she navigate towards the sea of Pontus, the coast of Asia Minor, or that of Africa? she acted in the same manner.</p>
<p>Her cities increased in prosperity, in proportion as they happened to have new people in their neighbourhood.
And what was extremely beautiful, she was surrounded on every side with a prodigious number of islands, drawn, as it were, in a line of circumvallation.</p>
<p>What a source of prosperity must Greece have found in those games, with which she entertained, in some measure, the whole globe; in those temples, to which all the kings of the earth sent their offerings; in those festivals, at which such a concourse of people used to assemble from all parts; in those oracles, to which the attention of all mankind was directed; and, in short, in that exquisite taste for the polite arts, which she carried to such a height, that to expect ever to surpass her, would be only betraying our ignorance.</p>
