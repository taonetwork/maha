          <p>MARSYAS dreamt that he had cut Dionysius&rsquo;s throat. Dionysius put him to death, pretending that = he would never have dreamt of such a thing by night if he had not thought o= f it by day. This was a most tyrannical action; for, though it had been t= he subject of his thoughts, yet he had made no attempt towards it. The laws do not take = upon them to punish any other than overt acts.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-12-indiscreet-speeches">Chapter 12: Indiscreet Speeches</h2>
<p>NOTHING renders the crime of high-treaso= n more arbitrary than declaring people guilty of it for indiscreet speeches= . Speech is so subject to interpretation; there is so great a difference be= tween indiscretion and malice; and frequently so little is there of the lat= ter in the freedom of expression, that the law can hardly subject people to= a capital punishment for words, unless it expressly declares what words th= ey are*.</p>
<p>Words do not constitute an overt act; th= ey remain only in idea. When considered by themselves, they have generally = no determinate signification; for this depends on the tone in which they ar= e uttered. It often happens that, in repeating the same words, they have no= t the same meaning: this depends on their connection with other things; and= sometimes more is signified by silence than by any expression whatever. Si= nce there can be nothing so equivocal and ambiguous as all this, how is it = possible to convert it into a crime of high-treason? Wherever this law is e= stablished, there is an end, not only of liberty, but even of its very shad= ow.</p>
<p>In the manifesto of the late Czarina aga= inst the family of the D=E2=80=99Olgoruckys=E2=80=A0, one of these princes is condemned to death = for having uttered some indecent words concerning her person; another, fo= r having maliciously interpreted her imperial laws, and for having offended= her sacred person by disrespectful expressions.</p>
<p>Not that I pretend to diminish the just = indignation of the public against those who presume to stain the glory of t= heir sovereign: what I mean is, that, if despotic princes are willing to mo= derate their power, a milder chastisement would be more proper, on those oc= casions, than the charge of high-treason, a thing always terrible even to i= nnocence itself.</p>
<p>Overt acts do not happen every day; they= are exposed to the eye of the public; and a false charge with regard to ma= tters of fact may be easily detected. Words, carried into action, assume th= e nature of that action. Thus a man, who goes into a public market-place to= incite the subject to revolt, incurs the guilt of high-treason, because th= e words are joined to the action, and partake of its nature. It is not the = words that are punished, but an action in which words are employed. They do= not become criminal, but when they are annexed to a criminal action. Every= thing is confounded if words are construed into a capital crime, instead o= f considering them only as a mark of that crime.</p>
<p>The emperors, Theod= osius, Arcadius, and Honorius, wrote thu= s to Rufinus, who was pr= =C3=A6fectus pr=C3=A6torio: =E2=80=9CThough a man should happen to s= peak amiss of our person, or government, we do not intend to punish him=C2=A7: if he has spoken t= hrough levity, we must despise him; if through folly, we must pity him; and= , if he wrongs us, we must forgive him. Therefore, leaving things as Edition: current; Page: [256] they= are, you are to inform us accordingly, that we may be able to judge of wor= ds by persons, and that we may duly consider whether we ought to punish or = overlook them.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-13-writings">Chapter 13: Writings</h2>
<p>IN writings there is something more perm= anent than in words; but, when they are no way preparative to high-treason,= they cannot amount to that charge.</p>
<p>And yet Augustus and Tiberius subjected satyrical writers t= o the same punishment as for having violated the law of majesty; Augustus=E2=88=A5, because of so= me libels that had been written against persons of the first quality; Tiber= ius, because of those which he suspected to have been written against himse= lf. Nothing was more fatal to Roman liberty. Cremutius= Cordus was accused of having called Cassius, in his annals, the las= t of the Romans=C2=B6.=</p>
<p>Satyrical writings are hardly known in d= espotic governments, where dejection of mind on the one hand, and ignorance= on the other, afford neither abilities, nor will, to write. In democracies= they are not hindered, for the very same reason which causes them to be pr= ohibited in monarchies: being generally levelled against men of power and a= uthority, they flatter the malignancy of the people, who are the governing = party. In monarchies they are forbidden; but rather as a subject of civil a= nimadversion, than as a capital crime. They may amuse the general malevolen= ce, please the malcontents, diminish the envy against public employments, g= ive the people patience to suffer, and make them laugh at their suffering= s.</p>
<p>But no government is so averse to satyri= cal writings as the aristocratical. There the magistrates are petty soverei= gns, but not great enough to despise affronts. If, in a monarchy, a satyric= al stroke is designed against the prince, he is placed on such an eminence = that it does not reach him; but an aristocratical lord is pierced to the ve= ry heart. Hence the decemvirs, who formed an aristocracy, punished satyrica= l writings with death*= .</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-14-breach-of-modesty-in-punishing-c-rimes">Chapter 14: Breach of Modesty in punishing C= rimes.</h2>
<p>THERE are rules of modesty observed by a= lmost every nation in the world: now, it would be very absurd to infringe t= hese rules in the punishment of crimes, the principal view of which ought a= lways to be the establishment of order.</p>
<p>Was it the intent of those oriental nati= ons who exposed women to elephants trained up for an abominable kind of pun= ishment, was it, I say, their intent to establish one law by the breach of = another?</p>
<p>By an ancient custom of the Romans it wa= s not permitted to put girls to death till they were ripe for marriage. Tib= erius found out an expedient of having them debauched by the executioner, b= efore they were brought to the place of punishment=E2=80=A0: that bloody and subtle tyrant destro= yed the morals of the people, to preserve their customs.</p>
<p>When the magistrates of Japan caused wom= en to be exposed naked in the market-places, and obliged Edition: current; Page: [258] them to go upon = all four like beasts, modesty was shocked: but, when they wanted to compel a mother &mdash; = when they wanted to force a son &mdash; I cannot proceed: even nature herself i= s struck with horror.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-15-the-infranchisement-of-slaves-in-order-to-accuse-their-master">Chapter 15: The Infranchisement of Slaves,= in Order to accuse their Master</h2>
<p>AUGUSTUS made a law, that the slaves of = those who conspired against his person should be sold to the public, that t= hey might depose against their master=C2=A7. Nothing ought to be neglected which may contribute t= o the discovery of a heinous crime: it is natural, therefore, that, in a go= vernment where there are slaves, they should be allowed to inform; but they= ought not to be admitted as witnesses.</p>
<p>Vindex disco= vered the conspiracy that had been formed in favour of Tarquin; but he was = not admitted a witness against the children of Brutus. It was right to give= liberty to a person who had rendered so great a service to his country; bu= t it was not given him with a view of enabling him to render this service.&lt;= /p&gt;</p>
<p>Hence the emperor Tacitus ordained, that= slaves should not be admitted as witnesses against their masters, even in = the case of high-treason= =E2=88=A5: a law which was not inserted in Justinian=E2=80=99s compilement.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-16-of-calumny-with-regard-to-the-c-rime-of-high-treason">Chapter 16: Of Calumny, with Regard to the C= rime of High-Treason</h2>
<p>TO do justice to the C=C3=A6sars, they w= ere not the first devisers of the horrid laws which they enacted. Edition: current; Page: [259] It is S= ylla* that taught them= that calumniators ought not to be punished: but the abuse was soon carried= to such excess as to reward them.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-17-the-revealing-of-conspiracies">Chapter 17: The Revealing of Conspiracies</h2>
<p>IF thy brother, the= son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, = or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, thou shalt surely= kill him, thou shalt stone him=E2=80=A1. This law of Deuteronomy cannot be a civil law am= ong most of the nations known to us, because it would pave the way for all = manner of wickedness.</p>
<p>No less severe is the law of several cou= ntries, which commands the subjects, on pain of death, to disclose conspira= cies in which they are not even so much as concerned. When such a law is es= tablished in a monarchical government, it is very proper it should be under= some restrictions.</p>
<p>It ought not to be applied, in its full = severity, but to the strongest cases of high-treason. In those countries it= is of the utmost importance not to confound the different degrees of this = crime. In Japan, where the laws subvert every idea of human reason, the cri= me of concealment is applied even to the most ordinary cases.</p>
<p>A certain relation=C2=A7 makes mention of two young ladies, wh= o were shut up for life in a box thick set Edition: current; Page: [260] with pointed nails; one for = having had a love intrigue, and the other for not disclosing it.</p>
