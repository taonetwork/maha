          <p>THE royal authority is a spring that oug= ht to move with the greatest freedom and ease. The Chinese boast of one of = their emperors, who governed, they say, like the heavens; that is, by his example.</p>
<p>There are some cases in which a sovereig= n ought to exert the full extent of his power, and others in which he shoul= d reduce it within narrower limits. The sublimity of administration consist= s in knowing the proper degree of power which should be exerted on differen= t occasions.</p>
<p>The whole felicity of monarchies consist= s in the opinion which the subjects entertain of the lenity of the governme= nt. A weak minister is ever ready to remind us of our slavery. But, grantin= g even that we are slaves, he should endeavour to conceal our misery from u= s. All he can say or write is, that the prince is uneasy, that he is surpri= sed, and that he will redress all grievances. There is a certain ease in co= mmanding: the prince ought only to encourage, and let the laws menace*.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-26-in-a-monarchy-the-prince-should-be-of-easy-access">Chapter 26: In a Monarchy, the Prince should be of easy Access.</h2>
<p>THE utility of this maxim will appear fr= om the inconveniency attending the contrary practice. =E2=80=9CThe Czar Pet= er I. says the sieur Perry= =E2=80=A1, has published a new edict, by which he forbids any of his su= bjects to offer him a petition till after having presented it to two of his= officers. In case of refusal of justice, they may present him a third; but= upon pain of death if they are in the wrong. After this no one ever presum= ed to offer a petition to the Czar.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-27-the-manners-of-a-monarch">Chapter 27: The Manners of a Monarch</h2>
<p>THE manners of a prince contribute as mu= ch as the laws themselves to liberty: like these, he may transfer men into = brutes, and brutes into men. If he prefers free and generous spirits, he will have subjects: if he likes base dastardly souls, he will have slaves. Wo= uld he know the great art of ruling, let him call honour and virtue to atte= nd his person, and let him encourage personal merit. He may even sometimes = cast an eye on talents and abilities. Let him not be afraid of those rivals= who are called men of merit; he is their equal when once he loves them.</p>
<p>Le= t him gain the hearts of his people, without subduing their spirits. Let hi= m render himself popular: he ought to be pleased with the affections of the= lowest of his subjects; for they too are men. The common people require so= very little condescension, that it is fit they should be humoured; the i= nfinite distance between the sovereign and them will surely prevent them fr= om giving him any uneasiness. Let him be exorable to supplication, and reso= lute against demands. Let him be sensible, in fine, that his people have hi= s refusals, while his courtiers enjoy his favours.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-28-the-regard-which-monarchs-owe-to-their-subjects">Chapter 28: The Regard which Monarchs owe to their Subjects</h2>
<p>PRINCES should be extremely circumspect with regard to raillery. It pleases with moderation, because it is an int= roduction to familiarity; but a satirical raillery is less excusable in the= m than in the meanest of their subjects; for it is they alone that give a m= ortal wound.</p>
<p>Much less should they offer a public aff= ront to any of their subjects: kings were instituted to pardon and to punis= h; but never to insult.</p>
<p>When they affront their subjects their t= reatment is more cruel than that of the Turk or the Muscovite. The insults = of these are a humiliation, not a disgrace: but both must follow from the i= nsolent behaviour of monarchs.</p>
<p>Such is the prejudice of the eastern nat= ions, that they look upon an affront from the prince as the effect of pater= nal goodness; and such, on the contrary, is our way of thinking, that, besi= des the cruel vexation of being affronted, we despair of ever being able to= wipe off the disgrace.</p>
<p>Princes ought to be overjoyed to have su= bjects to whom honour is dearer than life; an incitement to fidelity as wel= l as to courage.</p>
<p>They should remember the misfortunes tha= t have happened to sovereigns for insulting their subjects, Edition: current; Page: [271] the revenge= of Ch=C3=A6rea, of the eunuch Narses, of count Julian, and, in fi= ne, of the duchess of Montpensier, who, being e= nraged against Henry III. for having published some of her private failings= , tormented him during her whole life.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-29-the-civil-laws-proper-for-mixing-some-portion-of-liberty-in-a-despotic-government">Chapter 29: the civil Laws proper for mixing some Portion of Liberty in a despotic Government</h2>
<p>THOUGH despotic governments are of their= own nature every where the same, yet, from circumstances, from a religious= opinion, from prejudice, from received examples, from a particular turn of= mind, from manners or morals, it is possible they may admit of a considera= ble difference.</p>
<p>It is useful that some particular notion= s should be established in those governments: thus, in China, the prince is= considered as the father of his people; and, at the commencement of the em= pire of the Arabs, the prince was their preacher*.</p>
<p>It is proper there should be some sacred= book to serve for a rule; as the Koran among the Arabs, the books of Zoroa= ster among the Persians, the Vedam among the Indians, and the Classic Books= among the Chinese. The religious code supplies the civil, and fixes the ex= tent of arbitrary sway.</p>
<p>It is not at all amiss that, in dubious = cases, the judges should consult the ministers of religion=E2=80=A0: thus, in Turkey, the Cadis = consult the Mollachs. But, if it is a capital crime, it may be proper for t= he particular judge, if such there be, to take the governor=E2=80=99s advic= e, to the end that the civil and ecclesiastic power may be tempered also by= the political authority.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-30-the-same-subject-continued">Chapter 30: The same Subject continued.</h2>
<p>NOTHING but the very excess and rage of = despotic power ordained that the father=E2=80=99s disgrace should drag afte= r it that of his wife and children: they are wretched enough already, witho= ut being criminals. Besides, the prince ought to leave suppliants or mediat= ors between himself and the accused, to assuage his wrath, or to inform his= justice.</p>
<p>It is an excellent custom of the Maldavians, that, wh= en a lord is disgraced, he goes every day to pay his court to the king, til= l he is taken again into favour: his presence disarms the princes indignation.</p>
<p>In some despotic governments they have a notion that it = is trespassing against the respect due to their prince to speak to him in f= avour of a person in disgrace. These princes seem to use all their endeavou= rs to deprive themselves of the virtue of clemency.</p>
<p>Arcadius and= Honorius, by a law on which we have already descanted=E2=88=A5, positively declare= that they will shew no favour to those who shall presume to petition them = in behalf of the guilty. This was a very bad law indeed, since it is bad even under a despotic = government.</p>
<p>The custom of Persia, which permits ever= y man that pleases to leave the kingdom is excellent; and, though the contr= ary practice derives its origin from Edition: current; despotic power, which has ever consi= dered the subjects as slaves</p>
