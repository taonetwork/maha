          <p>LIBERTY is in its highest perfection whe= n criminal laws derive each punishment from the particular nature of the cr= ime. There are then no arbitrary decisions; the punishment does not flow fr= om the capriciousness of the legislator, but from the Edition: current; Page: [243] very nature of the = thing; and man uses no violence to man.</p>
<p>There are four sorts of crimes. Those of= the first species are prejudicial to religion; the second, to morals; the = third, to the public tranquility; and the fourth, to the security of the su= bject. The punishments inflicted for these crimes ought to proceed from the= nature of each of these species.</p>
<p>In the class of crimes that concern reli= gion I rank only those which attack it directly, such as all simple sacrile= ges: for, as to crimes that disturb the exercise of it, they are of the nat= ure of those which prejudice the tranquility or security of the subject, an= d ought to be referred to those classes.</p>
<p>In order to derive the punishment of sim= ple sacrileges from the nature of the thing=E2=80=A0, it should consist in depriving people of th= e advantages conferred by religion, in expelling them out of the temples, i= n a temporary or perpetual exclusion from the society of the faithful, in s= hunning their presence, in execrations, comminations, and conjurations.</p>
<p>In things that prejudice the tranquility= or security of the state, secret actions are subject to human jurisdiction= : but, in those which offend the Deity, where there is no public act, there= can be no criminal matter; the whole passes betwixt man and God, who knows= the measure and time of his vengeance. Now, if magistrates, confounding th= ings, should inquire also into hidden sacrileges, this inquisition would be= directed to a kind of action that does not at all require it; the liberty = of the subject would be subverted by arming the zeal of timorous, as well a= s of presumptuous, consciences against him.</p>
<p>The mischief arises from a notion, which= some people have entertained, of revenging the cause of the Deity. But we = must honour the Deity, and leave him to avenge his own cause. And, indeed, = were we to be directed by such a notion, where would be the end of punishme= nts? If human laws are to avenge the cause of an infinite Being, they will = be directed by his infinity, and not by the weakness, ignorance, and capric= e, of man.</p>
<p>An historian=E2=80=A1 of Provence relates a fact, which furnis= hes us with an excellent description of the consequences that may arise, in= weak capacities, from the notion of avenging the Deity=E2=80=99s cause. A = Jew was accused of having blasphemed against the virgin Mary; and, upon con= viction, was condemned to be flead alive. A strange spectacle was then exhi= bited: gentlemen masked, with knives in their hands, mounted the scaffold, = and drove away the executioner, in order to be the avengers themselves of t= he honour of the blessed virgin. =E2=80=94 I do not here choose to anticipa= te the reflections of the reader.</p>
<p>The second class consists of those crime= s which are prejudicial to morals. Such is the violation of public or priva= te continence; that is, of the police directing the manner in which the ple= asure annexed to the conjunction of the sexes is to be enjoyed. The punishm= ent of those crimes ought to be also derived from the nature of the thing. = The privation of such advantages as society has attached to the purity of m= orals, fines, shame, necessity of concealment, public infamy, expulsion fro= m home and society, and, in fine, all such punishments as belong to a corre= ctive jurisdiction, are sufficient to repress the temerity of the two sexes= . In effect, these things are Edition: current; Page: [245] less founded on malice than on carelessness= and self-neglect.</p>
<p>We speak here of none but crimes which r= elate merely to morals; for, as to those that are also prejudicial to the p= ublic security, such as rapes, they belong to the fourth species.</p>
<p>The crimes of the third class are those = which disturb the public tranquility. The punishments ought therefore to be= derived from the nature of the thing, and to be relative to this tranquili= ty; such as imprisonment, exile, and other like chastisements, proper for r= eclaiming turbulent spirits and obliging them to conform to the established= order.</p>
<p>I confine those crimes that injure the p= ublic tranquility to things which imply a bare offence against the police; = for, as to those which, by disturbing the public peace, attack at the same = time the security of the subject, they ought to be ranked in the fourth cla= ss.</p>
<p>The punishments inflicted upon the latte= r crimes are such as are properly distinguished by that name. They are a ki= nd of retaliation, by which the society refules security to a member who ha= s actually or intentionally deprived another of his security. These punishm= ents are derived from the nature of the thing, founded on reason, and drawn= from the very source of good and evil. A man deserves death when he has vi= olated the security of the subject so far as to deprive, or attempt to depr= ive, another man of his life. This punishment of death is the remedy, as it= were, of a sick society. When there is a breach of security with regard to= property, there may be some reasons for inflicting a capital punishment: b= ut it would be much better, and perhaps more natural, that crimes committed= against the security of property should be punished with the loss Edition: current; Page: [246] of pro= perty; and this ought indeed to be the case if mens fortunes were common or= equal. But, as those who have no property of their own are generally the r= eadiest to attack that of others, it has been found necessary, instead of a= pecuniary, to substitute a corporal, punishment.</p>
<p>All that I have here advanced is founded= in nature, and extremely favourable to the liberty of the subject.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-5-certain-accusations-that-require-particular-moderation-and-prudence">Chapter 5: Certain Accusations that require particular Moderation and Prudence</h2>
<p>IT is an important = maxim, that we ought to be very circumspect in the prosecution of wi= tchcraft and heresy. The accusation of these two crimes may be vastly injur= ious to liberty, and productive of infinite oppression, if the legislator k= nows not how to set bounds to it. For, as it does not directly point at a p= ersons actions, but at his character, it grows dangerous in propor= tion to the ignorance of the people; and then a man is sure to be always in= danger, because the most unexceptionable conduct, the purest morals, and t= he constant practice of every duty in life, are not a sufficient security a= gainst the suspicion of his being guilty of the like crimes.</p>
<p>Under Manuel Comnenus, the protestator that Aaron was detect= ed, as he was poring over a book of Solomon=E2=80=99s, the Edition: current; Page: [247] reading of whi= ch was sufficient to conjure up whole legions of devils. Now, by supposing = a power in witchcraft to rouse the infernal spirits to arms, people look up= on a man whom they call a sorcerer as the person in the world most likely t= o disturb and subvert society; and, of course, they are disposed to punish = him with the utmost severity.</p>
<p>But their indignation increases when wit= chcraft is supposed to have a power of subverting religion. The history of = Constantinople* inform= s us, that, in consequence of a revelation, made to a bishop, of a miracle= =E2=80=99s having ceased because of the magic practices of a certain person= , both that person and his son were put to death. On how many surprizing th= ings did not this single crime depend! =E2=80=94 That revelations should no= t be uncommon; that the bishop should be favoured with one; that it was rea= l; that there had been a miracle in the case; that this miracle had ceased;= that there was an art magic; that magic could subvert religion; that this = particular person was a magician; and, in fine, that he had committed that = magic act.</p>
<p>The emperor Theodor= us Lascaris attributed his illness to witchcraft. Those who were acc= used of this crime had no other resource left than to handle a red hot iron= without being hurt. Thus, among the Greeks, a person ought to have been a = sorcerer, to be able to clear himself of the imputation of witchcraft. Such= was the excess of their stupidity, that, to the most dubious crime in the = world, they joined the most dubious proofs of innocence.</p>
<p>Under the reign of = Philip the Long the Jews were expelled from France, being accused of= having poisoned the springs with their lepers. So absurd an accusation should make us doubt of all those that are founded on public hatred.</p>
<p>I have not here asserted that heresy oug= ht not to be punished; I said only that we ought to be extremely circumspec= t in punishing it.</p>
