          <p>GOD forbid that I should have the least = inclination to diminish the public horror against a crime which religion, m= orality, and civil government, equally condemn. It ought to be proscribed w= ere it only for its communicating to one sex the weaknesses of the other, a= nd for leading people, by a scandalous prostitution of their youth, to an i= gnominious old age. What I shall say concerning it will no ways diminish it= s infamy, being levelled only against the tyranny that may abuse the very h= orror we ought to have against the vice.</p>
<p>As a natural circumstance of this crime is secrecy, there are frequent instances of its having been punished by leg= islators upon the deposition of a child. This was opening a very wide door = to calumny. Justinian (says Procopius*) published a law against this crime: he ordered a= n inquiry to be made, not only against those who were guilty of it after th= e enacting of that law, but even before. The deposition of a single witness= , sometimes of a child, sometimes of a slave, was sufficient, especially ag= ainst such as were rich, and against those of the green faction.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>It is very odd that these three crimes, = witchcraft, heresy, and that against nature; (of which, the first might eas= ily be proved not to exist; the second, to be susceptible of an infinit= e number of distinctions, interpretations, and limitations; the third, to b= e often obscure and uncertain;) it is very odd, I say, that these three cri= mes should, amongst us, be punished with fire.</p>
<p>I may venture to affirm, that the crime = against nature will never make any great progress in society, unless people= are prompted to it by some particular custom; as among the Greeks, where t= he youths of that country performed all their exercises naked; as amongst u= s, where domestic education is disused; as among the Asiatics, where partic= ular persons have a great number of women whom they despise, while others c= an have none at all. Let there be no customs preparatory to this crime; let= it, like every other violation of morals, be severely proscribed by the ci= vil magistrate; and nature will soon defend or resume her rights. Nature, t= hat fond, that indulgent, parent, has strewed her pleasures with a bounteou= s hand; and, while she fills us with delights, she prepares us, by means of= our issue, (in whom we see ourselves, as it were, reproduced,) she prepare= s us, I say, for future satisfactions of a more exquisite kind than those v= ery delights.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-7-the-crime-of-high-treason">Chapter 7: The Crime of High-Treason</h2>
<p>IT is determined, by the laws of China, = that whosoever shews any disrespect to the emperor is to be punished with d= eath. As they do not mention in what this disrespect consists, every thing = may furnish a pretext to take away a man=E2=80=99s life, and to exterminate= any family whatsoever.</p>
<p>Two persons of that country, who were em= ployed to write the court-gazette, having inserted some circumstances Edition: current; Page: [250] rel= ating to a certain fact that were not true, it was pretended that to tell a= lie in the courtgazette was a disrespect shewn to the court; in consequenc= e of which they were put to death*. A prince of the blood having inadvertently made some mark on = a memorial signed with the red pencil by the emperor, it was determined tha= t he had behaved disrespectfully to the sovereign; which occasioned one of = the most terrible persecutions against that family that ever was recorded i= n history=E2=80=A0.</p>
<p>If the crime of high-treason be indeterm= inate, this alone is sufficient to make the government degenerate into arbi= trary power. I shall descant more largely on this subject when I come to treat of the co= mposition of laws.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-8-the-bad-application-of-the-n-ame-of-sacrilege-and-high-treason">Chapter 8: The bad Application of the N= ame of Sacrilege and High-Treason</h2>
<p>IT is likewise a shocking abuse to give = the appellation of high-treason to an action that does not deserve it. By a= n imperial law=C2=A7 i= t was decreed, that those who called in question the princes judge= ment, or doubted of the merit of such as he had chosen for a public office,= should be prosecuted as guilty of sacrilege. Surely it was the cabinet-council and the = prince=E2=80=99s favourites who invented that crime. By another law it was = determined that whosoever made any attempt to injure the ministers and offi= cers belonging to the sovereign should be deemed Edition: current; Page: = [251] guilty of high-treason, = as if he had attempted to injure the sovereign himself.</p>
<p>This law is owing to two princes*, remarkable for their w= eakness; princes who were led by their ministers, as flocks by shepherds; p= rinces who were slaves in the palace, children in the council, strangers to= the army; princes, in fine, who preserved their authority only by giving i= t away every day. Some of those favourites conspired against their sovereig= ns. Nay, they did more; they conspired against the empire; they called in b= arbarous nations; and, when the emperors wanted to stop their progress, the= state was so enfeebled, as to be under a necessity of infringing the law, = and of exposing itself to the crime of high-treason, in order to punish tho= se favourites.</p>
<p>And yet this is the very law which the j= udge of Monsieur de Cinq-Mars built upon=E2=80=A0, when, endeavouring to prove that the latter wa= s guilty of the crime of high-treason for attempting to remove cardinal Ric= helieu from the ministry, he says, =E2=80=9CCrimes that aim at the persons = of ministers are deemed, by the imperial constitutions, of equal consequenc= e with those which are levelled against the emperor=E2=80=99s own person. A= minister discharges his duty to his prince and to his country: to attempt,= therefore, to remove him, is endeavouring to deprive the former one of his= arms=E2=80=A1, and th= e latter of part of its power.=E2=80=9D It is impossible for the meanest to= ols of power to express themselves in more servile language.</p>
<p>By another law of Valentinian, Theodosiu= s, and Arcadius, false coiners are declared guilty of high-treason. Edition: current; Page: [252] But is not this confo= unding the ideas of things? Is not the very horror of high-treason diminish= ed by giving that name to another crime?</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-9-the-same-subject-continued">Chapter 9: The same Subject continued.</h2>
<p>PAULINUS having written to the emperor Alexander, that =E2=80=9Che was preparing to prosecute, for high-treason, a = judge who had decided contrary to his edict, the emperor answered,= =E2=80=9Cthat under his reign there was no such thing as indirect high-tre= ason*.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Faustinian wrote to the same emperor, th= at, as he had sworn by the prince=E2=80=99s life never to pardon his slave,= he found himself thereby obliged to perpetuate his wrath, lest he should i= ncur the guilt of l=C3=A6sa majestas; upon whic= h the emperor made answer, =E2=80=9CYour fears are groundless=E2=80=A0, and you are a stranger to= my principles.</p>
<p>It was determined, by a senatus-consultu= m=E2=80=A1, that whoso= ever melted down any of the emperor=E2=80=99s statues, which happened to be= rejected, should not be deemed guilty of high-treason. The emperors, Sever= us and Antoninus, wrote to Pontius=C2=A7, that those who sold unconsecrated statues of the empero= r should not be charged with high-treason. The same princes wrote to Julius= Cassianus, that, if a person, in flinging a stone, should by chance strike= one of the emperor&rsquo;s statues, he should not be liable to a prosecu= tion for high-treason=E2= =88=A5. The Julian law requires this sort of limitations; for, in virtu= e of this law, the crime of high-treason was charged, not only upon those= who melted down the emperor=E2=80=99s statues, but likewise on those who c= ommitted any such like action*, which made it an arbitrary crime. When a number of crimes of l=C3=A6sa majestas had been established, they were = obliged to distinguish the several sorts. Hence Ulpian, the civilian, after= saying that the accusation of l=C3=A6sa majestas did not die with the criminal, adds, that this does not relate to=E2=80=A0 all the treasonable= acts established by the Julian law, but only to that which implies an atte= mpt against the empire or against the emperor=E2=80=99s life.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-10-the-same-subject-continued">Chapter 10: The same Subject continued.</h2>
<p>THERE was a law passed in England, under Henry 8th by which whoever predicted the king=E2=80=99s death was declar= ed guilty of high-treason. This law was extremely vague: the terror of desp= otic power is so great, that it recoils upon those who exercise it. In this= king=E2=80=99s last illness the physicians would not venture to say he was= in danger; and surely they acted very right=E2=80=A1.</p>
