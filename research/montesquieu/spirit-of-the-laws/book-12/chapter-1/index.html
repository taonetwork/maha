          <p>IT is not sufficient to have treated of = political liberty as relative to the constitution; we must examine it likew= ise in the relation it bears to the subject.</p>
<p>We have observed, that, in the former ca= se, it arises from a certain distribution of the three powers; but, in the = latter, we must consider it in another light. It consists in security, or i= n the opinion people have of their security.</p>
<p>The constitution may happen to be free, = and the subject not. The subject may be free, and not the constitution. In = those cases the constitution will be free by right, and not in fact; the su= bject will be free in fact, and not by right.</p>
<p>It is the disposition only of the laws, = and even of the fundamental laws, that constitutes liberty in relation to t= he constitution. But, as it regards the subject, manners, customs, or recei= ved examples, may give rise to it, and particular civil laws may encourage = it, as we shall presently observe.</p>
<p>Farther; as, in most states, liberty is = more checked or depressed than their constitution requires, it is proper to= treat of the particular laws that, in each constitution, are apt to assist= or check the principle of liberty, which each state is capable of receivin= g.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-2-the-liberty-of-the-subject">Chapter 2: The Liberty of the Subject</h2>
<p>PHILOSOPHICAL liberty consists in the fr= ee exercise of the will; or, at least, if we must speak agreeably to all sy= stems, in an opinion that we have the free exercise of our will. Political = liberty consists in security; or, at least, in the opinion that we enjoy se= curity.</p>
<p>This security is never more dangerously = attacked than in public or private accusations. It is therefore on the good= ness of criminal laws that the liberty of the subject principally depends.</p>
<p>Criminal laws did not receive their full= perfection all at once. Even in places where liberty has been most sought = after it has not been always found. Aristotle* informs us, that, at Cum=C3=A6, the parents of the= accuser might be witnesses. So imperfect was the law, under the kings of R= ome, that Servius Tullus pronounced sentence against the children of Ancus = Martius, who were charged with having assassinated the king his father-in-l= aw=E2=80=A0. Under the= first kings of France, Clotarius made a law=E2=80=A1, that nobody should be condemned without be= ing heard; which shews that a contrary custom had prevailed in some particu= lar case, or among some barbarous people. It was Charondas that first estab= lished penalties against false witnesses=E2=88=A5. When the subject has no fence to secure his in= nocence, he has none for his liberty.</p>
<p>The knowledge already acquired in some c= ountries, or that may be hereafter attained in others, &lt;= span class=3D&quot;decoration&quot;&gt;Edition: current; Page: [242] concerning the sur= est rules to be observed in criminal judgements, is more interesting to man= kind than any other thing in the world.</p>
<p>Liberty can be founded on the practice o= f this knowledge only; and, supposing a state to have the best laws imagina= ble in this respect, a person tried under that state, and condemned to be h= anged the next day, would have much more liberty than a bashaw enjoys in Tu= rkey.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-3-the-same-subject-continued">Chapter 3: The same Subject continued.</h2>
<p>THOSE laws, which condemn a man to death= on the deposition of a single witness, are fatal to liberty. In right reas= on there should be two; because a witness who affirms, and the accused who = denies, make an equal balance, and a third must incline the scale.</p>
<p>The Greeks=C2=A7 and Romans=C2=B6 required one voice more to condemn: but our French= laws insist upon two. The Greeks pretend that their custom was established= by the Gods*; but thi= s more justly may be said of ours.</p>
