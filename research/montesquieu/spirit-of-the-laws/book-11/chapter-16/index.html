          <p>THERE were no rights to contest under th= e decemvirs; but, upon the restoration of liberty, jealousies revived; and,= so long as the patricians had any privileges left, they were sure to be st= ripped of them by the plebeians.</p>
<p>The mischief would not have been so great had the plebeians been satisfied with this success; but they also injured= the patricians as citizens. When the people assembled by curi=C3=A6, or ce= nturies, they were composed of senators, patricians, and plebeians. In thei= r disputes the plebeians gained this point,=E2=88=A5 that they alone, without patricians or senate, should enact the laws called plebiscita; and Edition: current; Page: [= 226] the assemblies, in which = they were made, had the name of comitia by tribes.</p>
<p>Thus there were cases in= which the patricians*= had no share in the legislative power, but=E2=80=A0 were subject to the legislation of another b= ody of the state. This was the extravagance of liberty. The people, to esta= blish a democracy, acted against the very principles of that government. On= e would have imagined that so exorbitant a power must have destroyed the au= thority of the senate. But Rome had admirable institutions. Two of these we= re especially remarkable; one by which the legislative power of the people = was established, and the other by which it was limited.</p>
<p>The censors, and, before them, the consu= ls,=E2=80=A1 modelled = and created, as it were, every five years, the body of the people: they exe= rcised the legislation on the very part that was possessed of the legislati= ve power. =E2=80=9CTiberius Gracchus (says Cicero) caused the free-men to b= e admitted into the tribes, not by the force of his eloquence, but by a wor= d, by a gesture; which had he not effected, the republic, whose drooping he= ad we are at present scarce able to uphold, would not even exist.=E2=80=9D&lt;= /p&gt;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the senate had the po= wer of rescuing, as it were, the republic out of the hands of the people, b= y creating a dictator, before whom the sovereign bowed his head, and the mo= st popular laws were silent.Edition: current; Page: [227]</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-17-the-executive-power-in-the-roman-republic">Chapter 17: The executive Power in the Roman Republic</h2>
<p>JEALOUS as the people were of their legi= slative power, yet they had no great uneasiness about the executive. This t= hey left almost intirely to the senate and to the consuls, reserving scarce= any thing more to themselves than the right of choosing the magistrates, a= nd of confirming the acts of the senate and of the generals.</p>
<p>Rome, whose passion was to command, whos= e ambition was to conquer, whose commencement and progress were one continu= ed usurpation, had constantly affairs of the greatest weight upon her hands= ; her enemies were ever conspiring against her, or she against her enemies.=</p>
<p>As she was obliged to behave on the one = hand with heroic courage, and on the other with consummate prudence, it was= requisite, of course, that the management of affairs should be committed t= o the senate. Thus the people disputed every branch of the legislative powe= r with the senate, because they were jealous of their liberty; but they had= no disputes about the executive, because they were animated with the love = of glory.</p>
<p>So great was the share the senate took i= n the executive power, that, as Polybius=E2=80=A0 informs us, foreign nations imagined that Rome = was an aristocracy. The senate disposed of the public money, and farmed out= the revenue; they were arbiters of the affairs of their allies; they deter= mined war or peace, and directed, in this respect, the consuls; they fixed = the number of the Roman and of the allied troops, disposed of the provinces= and armies to Edition: curre= nt; Page: [228] the consuls or pr=C3=A6tors, and, upon the expiration of t= he year of command, had the power of appointing successors; they decreed tr= iumphs, received and sent embassies; they nominated, rewarded, punished, an= d were judges of kings, declared them allies of the Roman people, or stripp= ed them of that title.</p>
<p>The consuls levied the troops which they= were to carry into the field; had the command of the forces by sea and lan= d; disposed of the forces of the allies; were invested with the whole power= of the republic in the provinces; gave peace to the vanquished nations, im= posed conditions on them, or referred them to the senate.</p>
<p>In the earliest times, when the people h= ad some share in the affairs relating to war or peace, they exercised rathe= r their legislative than their executive power. They scarce did any thing e= lse but confirm the acts of the kings, and, after their expulsion, those of= the consuls or senate. So far were they from being the arbiters of war, th= at we have instances of its having been often declared, notwithstanding the= opposition of the tribunes. But, growing wanton in their prosperity, they = increased their executive power. Thus they* created the military tribunes, the nomination of whom= , till then, had belonged to the generals; and, some time before the first = Punic war, they decreed, that only their own body should have the right=E2=80=A0 of declaring war.</p>
