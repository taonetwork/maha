            <h1>The judiciary Power in the Roman Government</h1>

          <p>THE judiciary power was given to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the people,</li>
<li>the senate,</li>
<li>the magistrates, and</li>
<li>particular judges.</li>
</ul>
<p>How were their civil affairs distributed?</p>
<p>The consuls had the judiciary power after the expulsion of the kings, as the praetors were judges after the consuls. Servius= Tullus had divested himself of the power of determining of civil causes, which was not resumed by the consuls, except in some very rare cases, for that reason cal= led extraordinary=C2=A7. They were satisfied with naming the judges a= nd establishing the several tribunals. By a discourse of Appius Claudius, in Dionysius=C2=B6 Halicarnasseus, it appears, that, so early as the 59th year of Rome, this was looked upon as a settled custom among the Roman= s; and it is not tracing it very high to refer it to Servius Tullus.</p>
<p>Every year, the praetor made a list of such as he= chose for the office of judges during his magistracy. A sufficient number = was pitched upon for each cause; a custom very near the same as that now pr= actised in England. And what was extremely favourable to liberty* was, the pr=C3=A6tor=E2=80=99s = fixing the judges with the consent of the parties. The great number of exceptions, tha= t can be made in England, amounts pretty near to this very custom.</p>
<p>The judges decided only the questions* relating to matter of f= act: for example, whether a sum of money had been paid or not; whether an a= ct had been committed or not. But, as to questions of law, as these required a certain c= apacity, they were always carried before the tribunal of the centumvirs.</p>
<p>The kings reserved to themselves the jud= gement of criminal affairs, and in this were succeeded by the consuls. It w= as in consequence of this authority that Brutus= put his children, and all those who were concerned in the Tarquinian consp= iracy, to death. This was an exorbitant power. The consuls, already investe= d with the military command, extended the exercise of it even to civil affa= irs; and their procedures, being stripped of all forms of justice, were rat= her exertions of violence than legal judgements.</p>
<p>This gave rise to the Valerian law, by which it was made lawful to appeal to the people= from every decision of the consuls that endangered the life of a citizen. = The consuls had no longer a power of pronouncing sentence in capital cases = against a Roman citizen, without the consent of the people=C2=B6.</p>
<p>We see, in the first conspiracy for the = restoration of the Tarquins, that the criminals were tried by Brutus the co= nsul; in the second, the senate and comitia were assembled to try them.</p>
<p>The laws, distinguished by the name of &lt;= span class=3D&quot;ital&quot;&gt;sacred, allowed the plebeians the privilege of c= hoosing tribunes; Edition: cu= rrent; Page: [231] from whence was formed a body, whose pretensions at fir= st were immense. It is hard to determine which was greater, the insolence o= f the plebeians in demanding, or the condescension of the senate in granting.</p>
<p>The Valerian law allowed of appeals to the people; that is, to the peopl= e composed of senators, patricians, and plebeians. The plebeians made a law= that appeals should be brought before their own body. A question was soon = after started, whether the plebeians had a right to try a patrician: this w= as the subject of a dispute to which the impeachment of Coriolanus gave ris= e, and which ended with that affair. When Coriolanus was accused by the tri= bunes before the people, he insisted, contrary to the spirit of the Valeria= n law, that, as he was a patrician, none but the consuls had a power to try= him: on the other hand, the plebeians also, contrary to the spirit of that= same law, pretended, that none but their body were empowered to be his jud= ges, and accordingly they pronounced sentence upon him.</p>
<p>This was moderated by the law of the twe= lve tables; whereby it was ordained, that none but the great assemblies of the people=E2=80=A0 should try a citizen in capital cases. Hence the = body of the plebeians, or (which amounts to the very same) the comitia by t= ribes, had no longer any power of hearing criminal causes, except such as w= ere punished with fines. To inflict a capital punishment, a law was requisite; but, to condemn to a pecuniary mulct, there= was occasion only for a plebiscitum.</p>
<p>This regulation of the law of the twelve= tables was extremely prudent. It produced an admirable balance between the= body of the plebeians and the senate: for, as the full judiciary power o= f both depended on the greatness of the punishment and the nature of the cr= ime, it was necessary they should both agree.</p>
<p>The Valerian law abolished all the remai= ns of the Roman government any way relative to that of the kings of the her= oic times of Greece. The consuls were divested of the power to punish crime= s. Though all crimes are public, yet we must distinguish between those whic= h more nearly concern the mutual intercourse of citizens, and those which m= ore immediately interest the state in the relation it bears to its subjects= . The first are called private; the second, public. The latter were tried by the people; and, in regard to the former, they named, by particular commi= ssion, a qu=C3=A6stor for the prosecution of each crime. The person chosen = by the people was frequently one of the magistrates, sometimes a private ma= n. He was called the qu=C3=A6stor of parricide,= and is mentioned in the law of the twelve tables.</p>
<p>The quaestor nominated the judge of = the question, who drew lots for the judges, and regulated the tribunal, in = which he presided.=E2=88= =A5</p>
<p>Here it is proper to observe what share = the senate had in the nomination of the qu=C3=A6stor, that we may see how f= ar the two powers were balanced. Sometimes the senate caused a dictator to = be chosen, in order to exercise the office of qu=C3=A6stor=C2=A7; at other times they ordained t= hat the people should be convened by a tribune, with a view of proceeding t= o Edition: current; Page: [233] the nomination of a qu=C3=A6stor=C2=B6: and, in fine, the people frequently appointed a magis= trate to make his report to the senate concerning a particular crime, and t= o desire them to name a qu=C3=A6stor, as may be seen in the judgement upon = Lucius Scipio* in Livy.</p>
<p>In the year of Rome 604, some of these commissions were rendered permanent. All criminal causes were gradually divided into diff= erent parts; to which they gave the name of perpetual = questions. Different praetors were created, to each of whom some= of those questions were assigned. They had a power, conferred upon them fo= r the term of a year, of trying such criminal causes as were any way relati= ve to those questions, and then they were sent to govern their province.</p>
<p>At Carthage the senate of the hundred wa= s composed of judges who enjoyed that dignity for life=E2=88=A5: But, at Rome, the pr=C3=A6tors w= ere annual; and the judges were not even for so long a term, but were nomin= ated for each cause. We have already shewn, in the sixth chapter of this bo= ok, how favourable this regulation was to liberty in particular governments= .</p>
<p>The judges were chosen from the order of= senators, till the time of the Gracchi. Tiberius Grac= chus caused a law to pass, that they should be taken from the equest= rian order; a change so very considerable, that the tribune boasted of havi= ng cut, by one rogation only, the sinews of the= senatorian dignity.</p>
<p>The three powers may be very well distributed in regard to the liberty of the cons= titution, though not so well in respect to the liberty of the subject. At R= ome the people had the greatest share of the legislative, a part of the exe= cutive, and part of the judiciary, power; by which means they had so great = a weight in the government, as required some other power to balance it.</p>
<p>The senate had part of the executive power, and some share of the legislative but th= is was not sufficient to counterbalance the weight of the people. It was ne= cessary that they should partake of the judiciary power; and accordingly th= ey had a share when the judges were chosen from among the senators. But, wh= en the Gracchi deprived the senators of the judicial power, the senate were no longer able= to withstand the people. To favour, therefore, the liberty of the subject,= they struck at that of the constitution: but the former perished with the = latter.</p>
<p>Infinite were the mischiefs that from th= ence arose. The constitution was changed at a time when the fire of civil d= iscord had scarce left any such thing as a constitution. The knights ceased to be that middle order which united the people to the senate; and the cha= in of the constitution was broke.</p>
<p>There were even particular reasons again= st transferring the judiciary power to the equestrian order. The constituti= on of Rome was founded on this principle, that none should be inlisted as s= oldiers but such as were men of sufficient property to answer for their con= duct to the republic. The knights, as persons of the greatest property, formed the cavalry of the legions. But, when their dignity increased, they r= efused to serve any longer in that capacity, and another kind of cavalry wa= s obliged to be raised. Thus Marius inlisted all sorts of people into his a= rmy, and soon after the republic was lost.*</p>
<p>Besides, the knights were the farmers of= the revenue; men whose great rapaciousness increased the public calamities= . Instead of giving to such as those the judicial power, they ought to have= been constantly under the eye of the judges. This we must say in commendat= ion of the ancient French laws, that they have acted towards the officers o= f the revenue with as great a diffidence as would be observed between enemi= es. When the judiciary power at Rome was transferred to the publicans, ther= e was then an end of all virtue, polity, laws, and government.</p>
<p>Of this we find a very ingenuous descrip= tion in some fragments of Diodorus Siculus and Dio. Mutius Scevola (says Diodorus) wanted to revive the ancient manners and the laudable custom of sober a= nd frugal living; for his predecessors, having entered into a contract with= the farmers of the revenue, who at that time were possessed of the judicia= ry power at Rome, had infected the province with all manner of corruption. = But Scevola made an example of the publicans, and imprisoned those by whom = others had been confined.</p>
<p>Dio informs us, that Publius Rutilius, his lieutenant, was equally obnoxious to the equestrian order, and that, upon his return,= they accused him of having received some presents, and condemned him to = a fine; upon which he instantly made a cession of his goods. His innocence = appeared in this, that he was found to be worth a great deal less than what= he was charged with having extorted, and he shewed a just title to what he= possessed: but he would not live any longer in the same city with such pro= fligate wretches.</p>
<p>The Italians, says Diodorus again, bought up whole dr= oves of slaves in Sicily, to till their lands, and to take care of their ca= ttle; but refused them a necessary subsistence. These wretches were then fo= rced to go and rob on the highways, armed with lances and clubs, covered wi= th beasts skins, and followed by large mastiffs. Thus the whole province wa= s laid waste, and the inhabitants could not call any thing their own but wh= at was secured by fortresses. There was neither proconsul nor praetor that could or would oppose this disorder, or that presumed to punish these s= laves, because they belonged to the knights, who, at Rome, were possessed of the judiciary power. And yet this was one of the causes of the war of the slaves. But I= shall add only one word more. A profession, deaf and inexorable, that can = have no other view than lucre, that was always asking and never granting, t= hat impoverished the rich and increased even the misery of the poor; such a= profession, I say, should never have been intrusted with the judiciary pow= er at Rome.</p>
