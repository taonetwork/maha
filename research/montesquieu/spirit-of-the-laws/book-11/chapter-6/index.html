          <p>IN every government there are three sorts of power: the legislative; the executive in respect to things dependent o= n the law of nations; and the executive in regard to matters that depend on= the civil law.</p>
<p>By virtue of the first, the prince or magistrate enacts temporary or perpetual laws, and amends or abrogates those = that have been already enacted. By the second, he makes peace or war, sends= or receives embassies, establishes the public security, and provides again= st invasions. By the third, he punishes criminals, or determines the disput= es that arise between individuals. The latter we shall call the judiciary p= ower, and the other, simply, the executive power of the state.</p>
<p>The political liberty of the subject is = a tranquillity of mind arising from the opinion each person has of his safe= ty. In order to have this liberty, it is requisite the government be so con= stituted as one man need not be afraid of another.</p>
<p>When the legislative and executive power= s are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there = can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch o= r senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical mann= er.</p>
<p>Again, there is no liberty if the judici= ary power be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were it join= ed with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be expos= ed to arbitrary controul; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were = it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and = oppression.</p>
<p>There would be an end of every thing, we= re the same man, or the same body, whether of the nobles or of the people, = to exercise those three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing th= e public resolutions, and of trying the causes of individuals.</p>
<p>Most kingdoms in Europe enjoy a moderate= government, because the prince, who is invested with the two first powers,= leaves the third to his subjects.</p>
<p>In Turkey, where these three powers are = united in the sultan=E2=80=99s person, the subjects groan under the most dr= eadful oppression.</p>
<p>In the republics of Italy, where these t= hree powers are united, there is less liberty than in our monarchies. Hence= their government is obliged to have recourse to as violent methods, for it= s support, as even that of the Turks; witness the state-inquisitors,* and the lion=E2=80=99s mout= h into which every informer may at all hours throw his written accusations.=</p>
<p>In what a situation must the poor subjec= t be, under those republics! The same body of magistrates are possessed, as= executors of the laws, of the whole power they have given themselves in = quality of legislators. They may plunder the state by their general determi= nations; and, as they have likewise the judiciary power in their hands, eve= ry private citizen may be ruined by their particular decisions.</p>
<p>The whole power is here united in one bo= dy; and, though there is no external pomp that indicates a despotic sway, y= et the people feel the effects of it every moment.</p>
<p>Hence it is that many of the princes of = Europe, whose aim has been levelled at arbitrary power, have constantly set= out with uniting, in their own persons, all the branches of magistracy, an= d all the great offices of state.</p>
<p>I allow, indeed, that the mere hereditar= y aristocracy of the Italian republics does not exactly answer to the despo= tic power of the Eastern princes. The number of magistrates sometimes moder= ates the power of the magistracy; the whole body of the nobles do not alway= s concur in the same design; and different tribunals are erected, that temp= er each other. Thus, at Venice, the legislative power is in the council, the executive in the pregadi= , and the judiciary in the quarantia. Bu= t the mischief is, that these different tribunals are composed of magistrat= es all belonging to the same body; which constitutes almost one and the sam= e power.</p>
<p>The judiciary power ought not to be give= n to a standing senate; it should be exercised by persons taken from the bo= dy of the people,* at = certain times of the year, and consistently with a form and manner prescrib= ed by law, in order to erect a tribunal that should last only so long as ne= cessity requires.</p>
<p>By this method, the judicial power, so t= errible to mankind, not being annexed to any particular state Edition: current; Page: [201] or profes= sion, becomes, as it were, invisible. People have not then the judges conti= nually present to their view; they fear the office, but not the magistrate.=</p>
<p>In accusations of a deep and criminal na= ture, it is proper the person accused should have the privilege of choosing= , in some measure, his judges, in concurrence with the law; or, at least, h= e should have a right to except against so great a number, that the remaini= ng part may be deemed his own choice.</p>
<p>The other two powers may be given rather= to magistrates or permanent bodies, because they are not exercised on any = private subject; one being no more than the general will of the state, and = the other the execution of that general will.</p>
<p>But, though the tribunals ought not to b= e fixt, the judgements ought; and to such a degree, as to be ever conformab= le to the letter of the law. Were they to be the private opinion of the jud= ge, people would then live in society without exactly knowing the nature of= their obligations.</p>
<p>The judges ought likewise to be of the s= ame rank as the accused, or, in other words, his peers; to the end, that he= may not imagine he is fallen into the hands of persons inclined to treat h= im with rigour.</p>
<p>If the legislature leaves the executive = power in possession of a right to imprison those subjects who can give secu= rity for their good behaviour, there is an end of liberty; unless they are = taken up in order to answer, without delay, to a capital crime; in which ca= se they are really free, being subject only to the power of the law.</p>
<p>But, should the legislature think itself= in danger, by some secret conspiracy against the state, or by a correspond= ence with a foreign enemy, it might authorize the executive power, for a sh= ort and limited time, to imprison suspected persons, who, in that Edition: current; Page: [202] case, w= ould lose their liberty only for a while, to preserve it for ever.</p>
<p>And this is the only reasonable method t= hat can be substituted to the tyrannical magistracy of the Ephori, and to the state inquisitors of Venice, who are also despotical.</p>
<p>As, in a country of liberty, every man w= ho is supposed a free agent ought to be his own governor, the legislative p= ower should reside in the whole body of the people. But, since this is impo= ssible in large states, and in small ones is subject to many inconveniences= , it is fit the people should transact by their representatives what they c= annot transact by themselves.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of a particular town are= much better acquainted with its wants and interests than with those of oth= er places; and are better judges of the capacity of their neighbours than o= f that of the rest of their countrymen. The members, therefore, of the legi= slature should not be chosen from the general body of the nation; but it is= proper, that, in every considerable place, a representative should be elec= ted by the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The great advantage of representatives i= s, their capacity of discussing public affairs. For this, the people collec= tively are extremely unfit, which is one of the chief inconveniences of a d= emocracy.</p>
<p>It is not at all necessary that the repr= esentatives, who have received a general instruction from their constituent= s, should wait to be directed on each particular affair, as is practised in= the diets of Germany. True it is, that, by this way of proceeding, the spe= eches of the deputies might, with greater propriety, be called the voice of= the nation; but, on the other hand, this would occasion infinite delays; w= ould give each deputy a power of controlling the assembly; and, on the mo= st urgent and pressing occasions, the wheels of government might be stopped= by the caprice of a single person.</p>
<p>When the deputies, as Mr. Sidney well ob= serves, represent a body of people, as in Holland, they ought to be account= able to their constituents; but it is a different thing in England, where t= hey are deputed by boroughs.</p>
<p>All the inhabitants of the several distr= icts ought to have a right of voting at the election of a representative, e= xcept such as are in so mean a situation as to be deemed to have no will of= their own.</p>
<p>One great fault there was in most of the= ancient republics, that the people had a right to active resolutions, such= as require some execution, a thing of which they are absolutely incapable.= They ought to have no share in the government but for the choosing of repr= esentatives, which is within their reach. For, though few can tell the exac= t degree of men=E2=80=99s capacities, yet there are none but are capable of= knowing, in general, whether the person they choose is better qualified th= an most of his neighbours.</p>
<p>Neither ought the representative body to= be chosen for the executive part of government, for which it is not so fit= ; but for the enacting of laws, or to see whether the laws in being are dul= y executed; a thing suited to their abilities, and which none indeed but th= emselves can properly perform.</p>
<p>In such a state, there are always person= s distinguished by their birth, riches, or honours: but, were they to be co= nfounded with the common people, and to have only the weight of a single vo= te, like the rest, the common liberty would be their slavery, and they woul= d have no interest in supporting it, as most of the popular resolutions wou= ld be against them. The share they have, therefore, in the legislature ough= t to Edition: current; Page: = [204]&lt;= /span&gt; be proportioned to their other advantages in the state; which happen= s only when they form a body that has a right to check the licentiousness o= f the people, as the people have a right to oppose any encroachment of thei= rs.</p>
<p>The legislative power is, therefore, com= mitted to the body of the nobles, and to that which represents the people; = each having their assemblies and deliberations apart, each their separate v= iews and interests.</p>
<p>Of the three powers abovementioned, the = judiciary is, in some measure, next to nothing: there remain, therefore, on= ly two: and, as these have need of a regulating power to moderate them, the= part of the legislative body composed of the nobility is extremely proper = for this purpose.</p>
<p>The body of the nobility ought to be her= editary. In the first place, it is so in its own nature; and, in the next, = there must be a considerable interest to preserve its privileges: privilege= s, that, in themselves, are obnoxious to popular envy, and of course, in a = free state, are always in danger.</p>
<p>But, as an hereditary power might be tem= pted to pursue its own particular interests, and forget those of the people= , it is proper, that, where a singular advantage may be gained by corruptin= g the nobility, as in the laws relating to the supplies, they should have n= o other share in the legislation than the power of rejecting, and not that = of resolving.</p>
<p>By the power of res= olving, I mean, the right of ordaining by their own authority, or of= amending what has been ordained by others. By the pow= er of rejecting, I would be understood to mean, the right of annulli= ng a resolution taken by another; which was the power of the tribunes at Ro= me. And, though the person possessed of the privilege of rejecting may like= wise have the right of approving, yet this approbation &lt;= span class=3D&quot;decoration&quot;&gt;Edition: current; Page: [205] passes for no more= than a declaration that he intends to make no use of his privilege of reje= cting, and is derived from that very privilege.</p>
<p>The executive power ought to be in the h= ands of a monarch, because this branch of government, having need of dispat= ch, is better administered by one than by many: on the other hand, whatever= depends on the legislative power, is oftentimes better regulated by many t= han by a single person.</p>
<p>But, if there were no monarch, and the e= xecutive power should be committed to a certain number of persons, selected= from the legislative body, there would be an end of liberty, by reason the= two powers would be united; as the same persons would sometimes possess, a= nd would be always able to possess, a share in both.</p>
<p>Were the legislative body to be a consid= erable time without meeting, this would likewise put an end to liberty. For= , of two things, one would naturally follow; either that there would be no = longer any legislative resolutions, and then the state would fall into anar= chy; or that these resolutions would be taken by the executive power, which= would render it absolute.</p>
<p>It would be needless for the legislative= body to continue always assembled. This would be troublesome to the repres= entative, and moreover would cut out too much work for the executive power,= so as to take off its attention to its office, and oblige it to think only= of defending its own prerogatives and the right it has to execute.</p>
<p>Again, were the legislative body to be a= lways assembled, it might happen to be kept up only by filling the places o= f the deceased members with new representatives; and, in that case, if the = legislative body were once corrupted, the evil would be past all Edition: current; Page: [206] remedy. = When different legislative bodies succeed one another, the people, who have= a bad opinion of that which is actually sitting, may reasonably entertain = some hopes of the next: but, were it to be always the same body, the people= , upon seeing it once corrupted, would no longer expect any good from its l= aws; and, of course, they would either become desperate or fall into a stat= e of indolence.</p>
<p>The legislative body should not meet of = itself. For a body is supposed to have no will but when it is met: and besi= des, were it not to meet unanimously, it would be impossible to determine w= hich was really the legislative body, the part assembled, or the other. And= , if it had a right to prorogue itself, it might happen never to be prorogu= ed; which would be extremely dangerous, in case it should ever attempt to e= ncroach on the executive power. Besides, there are seasons (some more prope= r than others) for assembling the legislative body: it is fit, therefore, t= hat the executive power should regulate the time of meeting, as well as the= duration, of those assemblies, according to the circumstances and exigence= s of a state, known to itself.</p>
<p>Were the executive power not to have a r= ight of restraining the encroachments of the legislative body, the latter w= ould become despotic: for, as it might arrogate to itself what authority it= pleased, it would soon destroy all the other powers.</p>
<p>But it is not proper, on the other hand,= that the legislative power should have a right to stay the executive. For,= as the execution has its natural limits, it is useless to confine it: besi= des, the executive power is generally employed in momentary operations. The= power, therefore, of the Roman tribunes was faulty, as it put a stop not o= nly to the legislation, Editi= on: current; Page: [207] but likewise to the executive part of government;= which was attended with infinite mischiefs.</p>
<p>But, if the legislative power, in a free= state, has no right to stay the executive, it has a right, and ought to ha= ve the means, of examining in what manner its laws have been executed; an a= dvantage which this government has over that of Crete and Sparta, where the= Cosmi and the Ephori gave no account of their administration.</p>
<p>But, whatever may be the issue of that e= xamination, the legislative body ought not to have a power of arraigning th= e person, nor, of course, the conduct, of him who is entrusted with the exe= cutive power. His person should be sacred, because, as it is necessary, for= the good of the state, to prevent the legislative body from rendering them= selves arbitrary, the moment he is accused or tried there is an end of libe= rty.</p>
<p>In this case, the state would be no long= er a monarchy, but a kind of republic, though not a free government. But, a= s the person, intrusted with the executive power, cannot abuse it without b= ad counsellors, and such as hate the laws as ministers, though the laws pro= tect them, as subjects these men may be examined and punished: an advantage= which this government has over that of Gnidus,= where the law allowed of no such thing as calling the Amymones* to a= n account, even after their administration=E2=80=A0; and therefore the people could never obtain = any satisfaction for the injuries done them.</p>
<p>Though, in general, the judiciary power = ought not to be united with any part of the legislative, yet Edition: current; Page: [208] this is lia= ble to three exceptions, founded on the particular interest of the party ac= cused.</p>
<p>The great are always obnoxious to popula= r envy; and, were they to be judged by the people, they might be in danger = from their judges, and would moreover be deprived of the privilege, which t= he meanest subject is possessed of in a free state, of being tried by his p= eers. The nobility, for this reason, ought not to be cited before the ordin= ary courts of judicature, but before that part of the legislature which is = composed of their own body.</p>
<p>It is possible that the law, which is cl= ear-sighted in one sense, and blind in another, might, in some cases, be to= o severe. But, as we have already observed, the national judges are no more= than the mouth that pronounces the words of the law, mere passive beings, = incapable of moderating either its force or rigour. That part, therefore, o= f the legislative body, which we have just now observed to be a necessary t= ribunal on another occasion, is also a necessary tribunal in this: it belon= gs to its supreme authority to moderate the law in favour of the law itself= , by mitigating the sentence.</p>
<p>It might also happen, that a subject, in= trusted with the administration of public affairs, may infringe the rights = of the people, and be guilty of crimes which the ordinary magistrates eithe= r could not, or would not, punish. But, in general, the legislative power c= annot try causes; and much less can it try this particular case, where it r= epresents the party aggrieved, which is the people. It can only, therefore,= impeach. But before what court shall it bring its impeachment? Must it go = and demean itself before the ordinary tribunals, which are its inferiors, a= nd, being composed moreover of men who are chosen from the people as well a= s itself, will naturally Edit= ion: current; Page: [209] be swayed by the authority of so powerful an a= ccuser? No: in order to preserve the dignity of the people and the security= of the subject, the legislative part which represents the people must brin= g in its charge before the legislative part which represents the nobility, = who have neither the same interests nor the same passions.</p>
<p>Here is an advantage which this governme= nt has over most of the ancient republics where this abuse prevailed, that = the people were at the same time both judge and accuser.</p>
<p>The executive power, pursuant to what ha= s been already said, ought to have a share in the legislature by the power = of rejecting; otherwise it would soon be stripped of its prerogative. But, = should the legislative power usurp a share of the executive, the latter wou= ld be equally undone.</p>
<p>If the prince were to have a part in the= legislature by the power of resolving, liberty would be lost. But, as it i= s necessary he should have a share in the legislature for the support of hi= s own prerogative, this share must consist in the power of rejecting.</p>
<p>The change of government at Rome was owi= ng to this, that neither the senate, who had one part of the executive powe= r, nor the magistrates, who were entrusted with the other, had the right of= rejecting, which was entirely lodged in the people.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the fundamental constitut= ion of the government we are treating of. The legislative body being compos= ed of two parts, they check one another by the mutual privilege of rejectin= g. They are both restrained by the executive power, as the executive is by = the legislative.</p>
<p>These three powers should naturally form= a state of repose or inaction: but, as there is a necessity for Edition: current; Page: [210] movement= in the course of human affairs, they are forced to move, but still in conc= ert.</p>
<p>As the executive power has no other part= in the legislative than the privilege of rejecting, it can have no share i= n the public debates. It is not even necessary that it should propose; beca= use, as it may always disapprove of the resolutions that shall be taken, it= may likewise reject the decisions on those proposals which were made again= st its will.</p>
<p>In some ancient commonwealths, where pub= lic debates were carried on by the people in a body, it was natural for the= executive power to propose and debate in conjunction with the people; othe= rwise their resolutions must have been attended with a strange confusion.</p>
<p>Were the executive power to determine th= e raising of public money otherwise than by giving its confent, liberty wou= ld be at an end; because it would become legislative in the most important = point of legislation.</p>
<p>If the legislative power were to settle = the subsidies, not from year to year, but for ever, it would run the risk o= f losing its liberty, because the executive power would be no longer depend= ent; and, when once it was possessed of such a perpetual right, it would be= a matter of indifference whether it held it of itself or of another. The s= ame may be said if it should come to a resolution of intrusting, not an ann= ual, but a perpetual, command of the fleets and armies to the executive pow= er.</p>
<p>To prevent the executive power from bein= g able to oppress, it is requisite that the armies with which it is intrust= ed should consist of the people, and have the same spirit as the people, as= was the case at Rome till the time of Marius. = To obtain this end, there are only two ways; either that the persons employed in the army should have sufficient property to answer for their conduc= t to their fellow-subjects, and be enlisted only for a year, as was customa= ry at Rome; or, if there should be a standing-army composed chiefly of the = most despicable part of the nation, the legislative power should have a rig= ht to disband them as soon as it pleased; the soldiers should live in commo= n with the rest of the people; and no separate camp, barracks, or fortress,= should be suffered.</p>
<p>When once an army is established, it oug= ht not to depend immediately on the legislative, but on the executive, powe= r; and this from the very nature of the thing, its business consisting more= in action than deliberation.</p>
<p>It is natural for mankind to set a highe= r value upon courage than timidity, on activity than prudence, on strength = than counsel. Hence the army will ever despise a senate, and respect their = own officers: they will naturally slight the orders sent them by a body of = men whom they look upon as cowards, and therefore unworthy to command them:= so that, as soon as the troops depend entirely on the legislative body, it= becomes a military government; and, if the contrary has ever happened, it = has been owing to some extraordinary circumstances. It is because the army = was always kept divided; it is because it was composed of several bodies, t= hat depended each on a particular province; it is because the capital towns= were strong places, defended by their natural situation, and not garrisone= d with regular troops. Holland, for instance, is still safer than Venice; s= he might drown or starve the revolted troops; for, as they are not quartere= d in towns capable of furnishing them with necessary subsistence, this subs= istence is of course precarious.</p>
<p>In perusing the admirable treatise of Ta= citus on the manners of the Germans,* we find it is from that nation the English have borrowed th= e idea of their political government. This beautiful system was invented fi= rst in the woods.</p>
<p>As all human things have an end, the sta= te we are speaking of will lose its liberty, will perish. Have not Rome, Sp= arta, and Carthage, perished? It will perish when the legislative power sha= ll be more corrupt than the executive.</p>
<p>It is not my business to examine whether= the English actually enjoy this liberty, or not. Sufficient it is for my p= urpose to observe, that it is established by their laws; and I inquire no f= arther.</p>
<p>Neither do I pretend by this to undervalue other governments, nor to say that this extreme political liberty ought = to give uneasiness to those who have only a moderate share of it. How shoul= d I have any such design; I who think that even the highest refinement of r= eason is not always desirable, and that mankind generally find their accoun= t better in mediums than in extremes?</p>
<p>Harrington, in his Oceana, has also enquired into the utmos= t degree of liberty to which the constitution of a state may be carried. Bu= t, of him, indeed, it may be said, that, for want of knowing the nature of = real liberty, he busied himself in pursuit of an imaginary one; and that he= built a Chalcedon, though he had a Byzantium before his eyes.</p>
