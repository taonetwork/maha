          <p>The laws that establish political liberty, as it relates to the constitution, and thos= e by which it is established, as it relates to the citizen. The former shal= l be the subject of this book; the latter I shall examine in the next.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-2-different-meanings-of-liberty">Chapter 2: Different Meanings of Liberty</h2>
<p>Liberty is the word that has the most meanings and has made the most impressions on the human mind. Some have taken it as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a facility of deposing a person on whom they had conferred a tyrannical authority:</li>
<li>others, for the power of choosing a superior whom they are obliged to obey;</li>
<li>others, for the right of bearing arms, and of being thereby ena= bled to use violence:</li>
<li>others, in fine, for the privilege of being governed = by a native of their own country, or by their own laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>One nation thought for a long time that liberty was in the privilege of wearing a long beard.
Some have annexed liberty to one form of government exclusive of others. Those who had a republican taste applied it to this species of polity.</p>
<p>Those who liked a monarchical state gave it to monarchy. Thus they have all applied the name of liberty to the government most suitable to their own customs and i= nclinations; and as, in republics, the people have not so constant and so p= resent a view of the causes of their misery, and as the magistrates seem to= act only in conformity to the laws, hence liberty is generally said to res= ide in republics, and to be banished from monarchies.</p>
<p>In fine, as in democr= acies the people seem to act almost as they please, this sort of government= has been deemed the most free, and the power of the people has been confou= nded with their liberty.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-3-in-what-liberty-consists">Chapter 3: In what Liberty consists</h2>
<p>In democracies, the people seem to act as they please. But political liberty does not consist in an unlimited freedom.</p>
<p>In governments, that is, in societies directed by laws= , liberty can consist only in the power of doing what we ought to will, and= in not being constrained to do what we ought not to will.</p>
<p>We must have continually present to our = minds the difference between independence and liberty. Liberty is a right o= f doing whatever the laws permit; and, if a citizen could do what they forb= id, he would be no longer possessed of liberty, because all his fellow-citi= zens would have the same power.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-4-the-same-subject-continued">Chapter 4: The same Subject continued.</h2>
<p>DEMOCRATIC and aristocratic states are n= ot in their own nature free. Political liberty is to be found only in moder= ate governments; and even in these it is not always found. It is there only= when there is no abuse of power: but constant experience shews us that eve= ry man invested with power is apt to abuse it, and to carry his authority a= s far as it will go. Is it not strange, though true, to say, that virtue it= self has need of limits?</p>
<p>To prevent this abuse, it is necessary, = from the very nature of things, power should be a check to power. A governm= ent may be so constituted, as no man shall be compelled to do things to whi= ch the law does not oblige him, nor forced to abstain from things which the= law permits.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-5-the-end-or-view-of-different-go-vernments">Chapter 5: The End or View of different Go= vernments.</h2>
<p>THOUGH all governments have the same gen= eral end, which is that of preservation, yet each has another particular ob= ject. Increase of dominion was the object of Rome; war, that of Sparta; rel= igion, that of the Jewish laws; commerce, that of Marseilles; public tranqu= illity, that of the laws of China*; navigation, that of the laws of Rhodes; natural liberty, that= of the policy of the savages; in general, the pleasures of the prince, tha= t of despotic states; that of monarchies, the prince&rsquo;s and the kingdom&rsquo;s glory: the independence of individuals Edition: current; Page: [198] is the end aimed at = by the laws of Poland; from thence results the oppression of the whole.</p>
<p>One nation there is also in the world, t= hat has, for the direct end of its constitution, political liberty. We shal= l presently examine the principles on which this liberty is founded: if the= y are sound, liberty will appear in its highest perfection.</p>
<p>To discover political liberty in a const= itution, no great labour is requisite. If we are capable of seeing it where= it exists, it is soon found, and we need not go far in search of it.</p>
