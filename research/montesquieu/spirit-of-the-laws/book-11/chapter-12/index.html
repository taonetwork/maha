          <p>THE government of the kings of Rome had = some relation to that of the kings of the heroic times of Greece. Its subve= rsion, like the latter=E2=80=99s, was owing to its general defect, though, = in its own particular nature, it was exceeding good.</p>
<p>In order to give an adequate idea of thi= s government, I shall distinguish that of the first five kings, that of Ser= vius Tullus, and that of Tarquin.</p>
<p>The crown was elective; and, under the f= ive first kings, the senate had the greatest share in the election.</p>
<p>Upon the king&rsquo;s decease, the sen= ate examined whether they should continue the established form of governmen= t. If they thought proper to continue it, they named a magistrate taken from their own b= ody, who chose a king: the senate were to approve of the election, the peop= le to confirm it, and the augurs to declare the approbation of the gods. If= any of these three conditions were wanting, they were obliged to proceed to another election.</p>
<p>The constitution was a mixture of monarc= hy, aristocracy, and democracy; and such was the harmony of power, that the= re was no instance of jealousy or dispute in the first reigns. The king com= manded the armies, and had the direction of the sacrifices; he had the powe= r of determining=E2=88=A5&lt;= /a&gt; civil and criminal= =C2=A7 causes; he called the senate together, convened the people, laid= some affairs before the latter, and regulated the rest with the senate*.</p>
<p>The authority of the senate was very gre= at. The kings oftentimes pitched upon senators with whom they sat in judgem= ent; and they never laid any affair before the people till it had been prev= iously debated=E2=80=A0 in that august assembly.</p>
<p>The people had the right of choosing magistrates, of = consenting to the new laws, and, with the king=E2=80=99s permission, of mak= ing war and peace: but they had not the judicial power. When Tullus Hostili= us referred the trial of Horatius to the people, he had his particular reas= ons, which may be seen in Dionysius Halicarnasseus.</p>
<p>The constitution altered under Servius Tullu= s. The senate had no share in his election; he caused himself to be proclai= med by the people; he resigned the power of hearing civil causes, reserving none to himself= but those of a criminal nature; he laid all Edition: current; Page: [219] affairs directly before the = people; eased them of the taxes, and imposed the whole burthen on the patri= cians. Hence, in proportion as he weakened the regal, together with the sen= atorian, power, he augmented that of the plebeians*.</p>
<p>Tarquin would neither be chosen by the s= enate nor by the people: he considered Servius Tullus as an usurper, and se= ized the crown as his hereditary right. He destroyed most of the senators; = those who remained he never consulted; nor did he even so much as summon th= em to assist at his decisions=E2=80=A0. Thus his power increased: but the odium of that power rec= eived a new addition, by usurping also the authority of the people, against= whose consent he enacted several laws. The three powers were, by these mea= ns, re-united in his person; but the people, at a critical minute, recollec= ted that they were legislators, and there was an end of Tarquin.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-13-general-reflections-on-the-stat-e-of-rome-after-the-expulsion-of-its-kings">Chapter 13: General Reflections on the Stat= e of Rome after the Expulsion of its Kings</h2>
<p>IT is impossible to be tired of so agree= able a subject as ancient Rome: thus strangers, at present, leave the moder= n palaces of that celebrated capital to visit the ruins; and thus the eye, = after recreating itself with the view of flowery meads, is pleased with the= wild prospect of rocks and mountains.</p>
<p>The patrician families were at all times= possessed of great privileges. These distinctions, which were considerable= under the kings, became much more important after their expulsion. Hence a= rose the Edition: current; Pa= ge: [220] jealousy of the plebeians, who wanted to reduce them. The contes= t struck at the constitution without weakening the government; for it was v= ery indifferent of what family were the magistrates, provided the magistrac= y preserved its authority.</p>
<p>An elective monarchy, like that of Rome,= necessarily supposeth a powerful aristocratic body to support it; without = which it changes immediately into tyranny or into a popular state. But a po= pular state has no need of this distinction of families to maintain itself.= To this it was owing that the patricians, who were a necessary part of the= constitution under the regal government, became a superfluous branch under= the consuls; the people could suppress them without hurting themselves, an= d change the constitution without corrupting it.</p>
<p>After Servius Tullus had reduced the pat= ricians, it was natural that Rome should fall from the regal hands into tho= se of the people. But the people had no occasion to be afraid of relapsing = under a regal power by reducing the patricians.</p>
<p>A state may alter two different ways; ei= ther by the amendment, or by the corruption, of the constitution. If it has= preserved its principles, and the constitution changes, this is owing to i= ts amendment; if, upon changing the constitution, its principles are lost, = this is because it has been corrupted.</p>
<p>The government of Rome, after the expuls= ion of the kings, should naturally have been a democracy. The people had al= ready the legislative power in their hands; it was their unanimous consent = that had expelled the Tarquins; and, if they had not continued steady to th= ose principles, the Tarquins might easily have been restored. To pretend th= at their design in expelling them was to render themselves slaves to a few = families, is quite absurd. The situation, therefore, of things required t= hat Rome should have formed a democracy, and yet this did not happen. There= was a necessity that the power of the principal families should be tempere= d, and that the laws should have a bias to democracy.</p>
<p>The prosperity of states is frequently g= reater, in the insensible transition from one constitution to another, than= in either of those constitutions. Then it is that all the springs of gover= nment are upon the stretch; that the citizens assert their claims; that fri= endships or enmities are formed amongst the jarring parties; and that there= is a noble emulation between those who defend the ancient, and those who a= re strenuous in promoting the new, constitution.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-14-how-the-distribution-of-the-three-powers-began-to-change-after-the-expulsion-of-the-kings">Chapter 14: How the Distribution of the three Powers began to change, after the Expulsion of the Kings.</h2>
<p>THERE were four things that greatly prej= udiced the liberty of Rome. The patricians had engrossed to themselves all = public employments whatever; an exorbitant power was annexed to the consula= te; the people were often insulted; and, in fine, they had scarce any influ= ence at all left in the public suffrages. These four abuses were redressed = by the people.</p>
<p>1st. It was regulated, that the plebeians might aspire to some magistracies; and by degr= ees they were rendered capable of them all, except that of interrex.</p>
<p>2nd. The consulate was dissolved into several other magistracies=E2=80=A1: pr=C3=A6tors were created, on whom t= he power was conferred of trying private causes; qu=C3=A6stors were nominated for determining th= ose of a criminal nature, =C3=A6diles were established for the civil admi= nistration; treasurers were made for the management of the public money; and, in fin= e, by the creation of censors, the consuls were divested of that part of th= e legislative power which regulates the morals of the citizens, and the tra= nsient polity of the different bodies of the state. The chief privileges le= ft them were, to preside in the great meetings of the people, to assemble the senate, an= d to command the armies.</p>
<p>3d. The sacre= d laws appointed tribunes, who had a power of checking the encroachments of= the patricians, and prevented not only private, but likewise public, injur= ies.</p>
<p>In fine, the plebeians increased their i= nfluence in the general assemblies. The people of Rome were divided in thre= e different manners; by centuries, by curi=C3=A6, and by tribes; and, whene= ver they gave their votes, they were convened one of those three ways.</p>
<p>In the first, the patricians, the leadin= g men, the rich, and the senate, which was very near the same thing, had al= most the whole authority; in the second they had less, and less still in th= e third.</p>
<p>The division into centuries was a division rather of estates and fortunes than of persons. The whole people were di= stributed into 193 centuries, which had each a single vote. The p= atricians and leading men composed the first 98 centuries; and the other 95 consisted of the remainder of the citizens. In this div= ision, therefore, the patricians were masters of the suffrages.</p>
<p>In the division into curi=C3=A6=C2=A7, the patricians had no= t the same advantages: some, however, they had; for it was necessary to con= sult the augurs, who were under the direction of the patricians; and no pro= posal could be made there to the people unless it had been previously laid = before the senate, and approved of by a senatus consultum. But, in the divi= sion into tribes, they had nothing to do either with the augurs or with the= decrees of the senate; and the patricians were excluded.</p>
<p>Now, the people endeavoured constantly t= o have those meetings by curi=C3=A6 which had been customary by centuries; = and by tribes, those they used to have before by curi=C3=A6: by which means= , the direction of public affairs soon devolved from the patricians to the = plebeians.</p>
<p>Thus, when the plebeians obtained the po= wer of trying the patricians, a power which commenced in the affair of Cori= olanus=C2=B6, they ins= isted upon assembling by tribes*, and not by centuries: and, when the new magistracies=E2=80=A0 of tribunes and =C3=A6d= iles were established in favour of the people, the latter obtained that the= y should meet by curi=C3=A6, in order to nominate them; and, after their po= wer was quite settled, they gained=E2=80=A1 so far their point as to assemble by tribes, to proce= ed to this nomination.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="chapter-15-how-rome-in-the-flour-ishing-state-of-that-republic-suddenly-lost-its-liberty">Chapter 15: How Rome, in the flour= ishing State of that Republic, suddenly lost its Liberty.</h2>
<p>IN the heat of the contests between the patricians and plebeians, the latter insisted upon having fixt laws, to the= end that the public judgements should no longer be the effects of capricio= us will or arbitrary power. The senate, after a great deal of resistance, a= cquiesced, and decemvirs were nominated to compose those laws. It was thoug= ht proper to grant them an extraordinary power, because they were to give l= aws to parties whose views and interests it was almost impossible to unite.</p>
<p>The nomination of all magistrates was suspended; and the decemvirs were ch= osen in the comitia sole administrators of the republic. Thus they found th= emselves invested with the consular and with the tribunitian power. By one,= they had the privilege of assembling the senate; by the other, that of con= vening the people: but they assembled neither senate nor people. Ten men on= ly of the republic had the whole legislative, the whole executive, and the = whole judiciary, power. Rome saw herself enslaved by as cruel a tyranny as = that of Tarquin. When Tarquin trampled on the liberty of that city, she was= seized with indignation at the power he had usurped; when the decemvirs exercised every act of oppression, she was astonished at the extraordinary po= wer she had granted.</p>
<p>What a strange system of tyranny! A tyra= nny carried on by men who had obtained the political and military power mer= ely from their knowledge in civil affairs; and who, at that very juncture, = stood in need of the courage of those citizens to protect them abroad, who = so tamely submitted to domestic oppression.</p>
<p>The spectacle of Virginia&rsquo;s death, whom her father immolated to chastity and liberty, put an end to the pow= er of the decemvirs. Every man became free, because every man had been injured: each shewed himself a citizen, because each had the tie of a parent. T= he senate and the people resumed a liberty which had been committed to ridiculous tyrants.</p>
<p>No people were so easily moved with publ= ic spectacles as the Romans. That of the impurpled body of Lucretia put an = end to the regal government. The debtor, who appeared in the forum covered = with wounds, caused an alteration in the republic. The decemvirs owed their= expulsion to the tragedy of Virginia. To condemn Manlius, it was necessary= to keep the people from seeing the Capitol. C=C3=A6sar=E2=80=99s bloody ga= rment flung Rome again into slavery.</p>
