          <p>SUCH was the distribution of the three p= owers in Rome. But they were far from being thus distributed in the provinc= es: liberty prevailed in the center, and tyranny in the extreme parts.</p>
<p>While Rome extended her dominions no far= ther than Italy, the people were governed as confederates, and the laws of = each republic were preserved. But, when she enlarged her conquests, and the= senate had no longer an immediate inspection over the provinces, nor the m= agistrates residing at Rome were any longer capable of governing the empire= , they were obliged to send pr=C3=A6tors and proconsuls. Then it was that t= he harmony of the three powers was lost. The persons appointed to that offi= ce were intrusted with a power which comprehended that of all the Roman mag= istracies; nay, even that of the people=C2=B6. They were despotic magistrates, extremely well ada= pted to the distance of the places to which they were destined. They exerci= sed the three powers; and were, if I may presume to use the expression, the= bashaws of the republic.</p>
<p>We have elsewhere observed, that, in a c= ommonwealth, the same magistrate ought to be possessed of the executive pow= er, as well civil as military. Hence a conquering republic can hardly commu= nicate her government, and rule the conquered state according to her own co= nstitution. And, indeed, as the magistrate she sends to govern is invested = with the executive power, both civil and military, he must also have the le= gislative: for who is it that could make laws without him? It is necessary,= therefore, that Edition: cur= rent; Page: [238] the governor she sends be intrusted with the three power= s, as was practised in the Roman provinces.</p>
<p>It is more easy for a monarchy to commun= icate its government, because the officers it sends have, some the civil, a= nd others the military, executive power; which does not necessarily imply a= despotic authority.</p>
<p>It was a privilege of the utmost consequ= ence to a Roman citizen to have none but the people for his judges. Were it= not for this, he would have been subject, in the provinces, to the arbitra= ry power of a proconsul or of a propr=C3=A6tor. The city never felt the tyr= anny, which was exercised only on conquered nations.</p>
<p>Thus, in the Roman world, as at Sparta, = the freemen enjoyed the highest degree of liberty, while those who were sla= ves laboured under the extremity of servitude.</p>
<p>While the citizens paid taxes they were = raised with great justice and equality. The regulation of Servius Tullus wa= s observed, who had distributed the people into six classes, according to t= heir difference of property, and fixed the several shares of the public imp= osts in proportion to that which each person had in the government. Hence t= hey bore with the greatness of the tax, because of their proportionable gre= atness of credit; and consoled themselves for the smallness of their credit= , because of the smallness of the tax.</p>
<p>There was also another thing worthy of a= dmiration, which is, that, as Servius Tullus=E2=80=99s division into classe= s was in some measure the fundamental principle of the constitution, it the= nce followed that an equal levying of the taxes was so connected with this = fundamental principle, that the one could not be abolished without the other.</p>
<p>But, while the city paid the taxes as sh= e pleased, or paid none at all*, the provinces were plundered by the knights, who were the farmer= s of the public revenue. We have already made mention of their oppressive e= xtortions, with which all history abounds.</p>
<p>Mithridates says that all Asia expects me as her deliverer.  so great is the hatred which the rapaciousness of the proconsu= ls=E2=80=A1, the consi= scations made by the officers of the revenue, and the quirks and cavils of = judicial proceedings=E2=88= =A5, have excited against the Romans.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Hence, the strength of the provinces weakened the strength of the Republic. Hence it was that the provinces looked upon the loss of the liberty of Ro= me as the epocha of their own freedom.</p>
<!-- 
CHAP. XX.: The End of this Book.

I should be glad to inquire into the dis= tribution of the three powers in all the moderate governments we are acquai= nted with, in order to calculate the degrees of liberty which each may enjo= y. But we must not always exhaust a subject, so as to leave no work at all = for the reader. My business is not to make people read, but to make them think. --><blockquote>
