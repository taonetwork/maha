          <p>HE did not set out upon his expedition t= ill he had secured Macedonia against the neighbouring barbarians and comple= ted the reduction of Greece; he availed himself of this conquest for no oth= er end than for the execution of his grand enterprize; he rendered the jeal= ousy of the Laced=C3=A6monians of no effect; he attacked the maritime provi= nces; he caused his land forces to keep close to the sea coast, that they m= ight not be separated from his fleet; he made an admirable use of disciplin= e against numbers; he never wanted provisions; and, if it be true, that vic= tory gave him every thing, he, in his turn, did every thing to obtain it.</p>
<p>In the beginning of his enterprize, a ti= me when the least check might have proved his destruction, he trusted very = little to fortune; but, when his reputation was established by a series of = prosperous events, he sometimes had recourse to temerity. When, before his = departure for Asia, he marched against the Triballians and Illyrians, you find he waged war* ag= ainst those people in the very same manner as C=C3=A6sar afterwards conduct= ed that against the Gauls. Upon his return to Greece, it was in some measure against his= will that he took and destroyed Thebes. When he invested the city, he want= ed the inhabitants to come into terms of peace; but they hastened their own= ruin. When it was debated whether he should attack the Persian fleet=E2=80=A1, it is Parmenio th= at shews his presumption, Alexander his wisdom. His aim was to draw the Per= sians from the sea-coast, and to lay them under a necessity of abandoning t= heir marine, in which they had a manifest superiority. Tyre being from prin= ciple attached to the Persians, who could not subsist without the commerce = and navigation of that city, Alexander destroyed it. He subdued Egypt, whic= h Darius had left bare of troops, while he was assembling immense armies in= another world.</p>
<p>To the passage of the Granicus Alexander= owed the conquest of the Greek colonies; to the battle of Issus, the reduc= tion of Tyre and Egypt; to the battle of Arbela, the empire of the world.</p>
<p>After the battle of Issus, he suffered D= arius to escape, and employed his time in securing and regulating his conqu= ests: after the battle of Arbela, he pursued him so close as to leave him no place of = shelter in his empire. Darius enters his towns, his provinces, to quit them= the next moment; and Alexander marches with such rapidity, that the empire= of the world seems to be rather the prize of an Olympian race than the fru= it of a great victory.</p>
<p>In this manner he carried on his conques= ts; let us now see how he preserved them.</p>
<p>He opposed those who would have had him = treat the Greeks as masters=C2=A7 and the Persians as slaves. He thought only of uniting the two = nations, and of abolishing the distinctions of a conquering and a conquered= people. After he had completed his victories, he relinquished all those pr= ejudices that had helped him to obtain them. He assumed the manners of the = Persians, that he might not chagrine them too much by obliging them to conf= orm to those of the Greeks. It was this humanity which made him shew so gre= at a respect for the wife and mother of Darius; and this that made him so c= ontinent. What a conqueror! he is lamented by all the nations he has subdue= d! What an usurper! at his death, the very family he has cast from the thro= ne is all in tears. These were the most glorious passages in his life, and = such as history cannot produce an instance of in any other conqueror.</p>
<p>Nothing consolidates a conquest more tha= n the union formed between the two nations by marriages. Alexander chose hi= s wives from the nation he had subdued; he insisted on his courtiers doing = the same; and the rest of the Macedonians followed the example. The Franks = and Burgundians permitted those marriages=C2=B6: the Visigoths forbad them in Spain, and afterwar= ds allowed them*. By t= he Lombards they were not only allowed but encouraged=E2=80=A0. When the Romans wanted to weaken = Macedonia, they ordered that there should be no inter-marriages between the= people of different provinces.</p>
<p>Alexander, whose aim was to unite the tw= o nations, thought fit to establish in Persia a great number of Greek colon= ies. He built, therefore, a multitude of towns; and so strongly were all th= e parts of this new empire cemented, that, after his decease, amidst the di= sturbances and confusion of the most frightful civil wars, when the Greeks = had reduced themselves, as it were, to a state of annihilation, not a singl= e province of Persia revolted.</p>
<p>To prevent Greece and Macedon from being= too much exhausted, he sent a colony of Jews=E2=80=A1 to Alexandria: the manners of those people= signified nothing to him, provided he could be sure of their fidelity.</p>
<p>He not only suffered the conquered natio= ns to retain their own customs and manners, but likewise their civil laws; = and frequently the very kings and governors to whom they had been subject. The Macedonians he placed at the head of the troops, and the natives of the country at t= he head of the government; rather choosing to run the hazard of a particula= r disloyalty (which sometimes happened) than of a general revolt.</p>
<p>He paid a great respect to the ancient t= raditions, and to all the public monuments of the glory or vanity of nation= s. The Persian monarchs having destroyed the temples of the Greeks, Babylon= ians, and Egyptians, Alexander rebuilt them=C2=A7. Few nations submitted to his yoke to whose rel= igion he did not conform: and his conquests seem to have been intended only= to make him the particular monarch of each nation, and the first inhabitan= t of each city. The aim of the Romans, in conquest, was, to destroy; his,= to preserve: and, wherever he directed his victorious arms, his chief view= was to atchieve something, from whence that country might derive an increa= se of prosperity and power. To attain this end, he was enabled, first of al= l, by the greatness of his genius; secondly, by his frugality and private economy; thirdly, by his profusion in matters of importance. He was close and reserved= in his private expences, but generous to the highest degree in those of a = public nature. In regulating his household, he was the private Macedonian; = but, in paying the troops, in sharing his conquests with the Greeks, and in= his largesses to every soldier in his army, he was Alexander.</p>
<p>He committed two very bad actions, in se= tting Persepolis on fire, and slaying Clitus; but he rendered them famous b= y his repentance. Hence it is that his crimes are forgot, while his regard = for virtue was recorded: they were considered rather as unlucky accidents, = than as his own deliberate acts. Posterity, struck with the beauty of his m= ind, even in the midst of his irregular passion, can view him only with pit= y, but never with an eye of hatred.</p>
<p>Let us draw a comparison between him and= C=C3=A6sar. The Roman general, by attempting to imitate the Asiatic monarc= h, flung his fellow-citizens into a state of despair for a matter of mere o= stentation; the Macedonian prince, by the same imitation, did a thing which= was quite agreeable to his original scheme of conquest.</p>
