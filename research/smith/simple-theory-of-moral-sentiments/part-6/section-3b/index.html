          <p>14 The point of propriety is the degree of any passion which the impartial spectator approves of. This point is differently situated in different passions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some passions, the excess is less disagreeable than the shortage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In such passions, the point of propriety seems to stand high, or nearer to the excess than to the shortage.</p>
<!-- The spectator is most disposed to sympathize with these passions.
The immediate feeling or sensation of these passions is agreeable to the person principally concerned. -->
<blockquote>
<p>In other passions, the shortage is less disagreeable than the excess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In such passions, the point of propriety seems to stand low, or nearer to the defect than to the excess.</p>
<!-- The spectator is least disposed to sympathize with these passions.
The immediate feeling of these passions is disagreeable to the person principally concerned. -->
<p>As a general rule, the passions which the spectator can sympathize with are those which have a high point of propriety. Their immediate feeling is agreeable to the subject-person.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the passions which the spectator cannot easily sympathize with are those which have a low point of propriety.</p>
<p>, are those of which the immediate feeling is more or less disagreeable or even painful, to the person principally concerned.</p>
<p>This rule has no exception.</p>
<!-- A few examples will sufficiently explain it and demonstrate its truth at once. -->
<br>
<h3 id="the-unifying-and-divisive-force">The Unifying and Divisive Force</h3>
<p>15 A man might show <!-- The disposition to the affections which unite men in society, --> excessive humanity, kindness, natural affection, friendship, or esteem to others. However, we <!-- even the excess of this disposition --> still regard it with compassion and kindness.</p>
<!-- We are more sorry for it than angry at it. -->
<p>He sees his excessive affections as agreeable and delicious. Rude people might give him heartfelt distress. In such a case, we <!--  sometimes, especially when directed towards unworthy objects.
However, even on such occasions, a well-disposed mind --> regard him with pity.</p>
<p>He feels the highest indignation against those who hates his weakness and imprudence.</p>
<p>Those people have a lack of such affections <!-- The defect of this disposition --> and is called &lsquo;the hardness of heart&rsquo;. It renders:</p>
<ul>
<li>a man insensible to other people&rsquo;s feelings and distresses.</li>
<li>other people equally insensible to his.</li>
</ul>
<!-- By excluding him from the friendship of all the world, it excludes him from the best and most comfortable of all social enjoyments. -->
<p>16 The disposition to drive men from one another tends to break the bands of human society. The disposition to anger, hatred, envy, malice, revenge offends by its excess than its shortage.</p>
<p>The excess <!-- renders a man wretched and miserable in his own mind. --> makes a man as the object of hatred, and sometimes even of horror, to other people.</p>
<p>The shortage of those passions is very seldom complained of.</p>
<!-- However, it may be defective. -->
<p>A manly character lacks a sense of revenge. This shortage of revenge makes him incapable of protecting himself or his friends from insult and injustice.</p>
<!-- of proper indignation is a most essential defect in the . -->
<p>Envy is an odious and detestable passion. Even its excess and improper direction can be a shortage.</p>
<ul>
<li>An envious man dislikes the superiority of really superior people. <!-- those who are really entitled to all their superiority -->.</li>
<li>A man who allows inferior people to <!-- However, the man who tamely allows others, who are not entitled to such superiority, to --> rise above him in important matters, is justly condemned as mean-spirited.</li>
</ul>
<p>This weakness is commonly founded in:</p>
<ul>
<li>indolence,</li>
<li>good nature, sometimes,</li>
<li>an aversion to opposition, bustle and solicitation, and</li>
<li>a sort of ill-judged magnanimity, sometimes.</li>
</ul>
<p>A man with a lack of envy imagines that he can despise the advantage of superiority, and so he <!--   It fancies that it can always continue to despise the advantage which it then despises, and, therefore, so --> easily gives up.
However, such weakness is commonly followed by much regret and repentance.</p>
<p>What seemed as magnanimity in the beginning frequently gives way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>envy in the end, and</li>
<li>a hatred of that superiority attained by others.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to live comfortably, we always need to defend our dignity and rank just as we defend our life or fortune.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="sensibility-and-insensibility">Sensibility and Insensibility</h3>
<p>17 Our sensibility to personal danger and distress, like that to personal provocation, is much more apt to offend by its excess than by its defect.</p>
<p>No character is more contemptible than that of a coward.
No character is more admired than that of the man who:
faces death with intrepidity
maintains his tranquillity and presence of mind amidst the most dreadful dangers
We esteem the man who supports pain and even torture with manhood and firmness.
We can have little regard for the man who:
sinks under them
abandons himself to useless outcries and womanish lamentations
His fretful temper makes him:
feel every little cross accident with too much sensibility
miserable in himself
offensive to other people
A calm character which does not allow its tranquility to be disturbed by the small injuries or little disasters:
is a blessing to the man himself, and
gives ease and security to all his companions.
Amidst the natural and moral evils infesting the world, this character:
lays its account, and
is contented to suffer a little from both evils.</p>
<p>18 Our sensibility to our own injuries and misfortunes is generally too strong.</p>
<p>It may likewise be too weak.
The man who feels little for his own misfortunes must always:
feel less for those of other people
be less disposed to relieve them
The man who has little resentment for the injuries done to himself must always:
have less resentment for those done to other people
be less disposed to protect or avenge them
A stupid insensibility to the events of human life necessarily extinguishes all that keen and earnest attention to the propriety of our own conduct.
This propriety is the real essence of virtue.
We can feel little anxiety about the propriety of our own actions when we are indifferent about their effects.
The real man of virtue is alone someone who:</p>
<p>feels the full distress of the calamity which has befallen him,
feels the whole baseness of the injustice done to him, but feels more strongly the dignity required by his own character
does not abandon himself to undisciplined passions naturally inspired by his situation
governs his whole behaviour and conduct according to those restrained and corrected emotions which the great inmate, the great demi-god within the breast prescribes and approves of
A real man of virtue is the only real and proper object of love, respect, and admiration.</p>
<p>Insensibility is so different from that exalted self-command.
That noble firmness is founded in the sense of dignity and propriety.
In many cases, the merit of self-command is entirely removed in proportion as insensibility takes place.</p>
<p>19 The total lack of sensibility to personal injury, danger, and distress would remove the whole merit of self-command.</p>
<p>However, that sensibility may very easily be too exquisite.
It frequently is so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sense of propriety is the authority of the judge within the breast.
That authority must appear very noble and great when it can control this extreme sensibility.
But its exertion may be too fatiguing.
It may have too much to do.
The individual may behave perfectly well through a great effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contest between the two principles is the warfare within the breast.
It may be too violent to be consistent with internal tranquility and happiness.
The wise man will avoid, as much as duty and propriety will permit, the situations he is not perfectly fit for.
He was endowed by Nature with this too exquisite sensibility.
His too lively feelings have not been sufficiently blunted and hardened by early education and proper exercise.
A man with feeble and delicate constitution might render him too sensible to pain, hardship, and bodily distress.
He should not wantonly embrace the profession of a soldier.
The man who is too much sensible to injury should not rashly engage in the contests of faction.
The sense of propriety might be strong enough to command all those sensibilities
But the mind&rsquo;s composure must always be disturbed in the struggle.
In this disorder, the judgment cannot always maintain its ordinary acuteness and precision.
He may always mean to act properly.
But he may often act:
rashly and imprudently, and
in a way which he himself will be forever ashamed of later.
Undoubtedly, the best preparatives for all the great exertions of self-command are a certain:
intrepidity,
firmness of nerves, and
hardiness of constitution, whether natural or acquired.</p>
<p>20 War and faction are certainly the best:</p>
<p>schools for forming every man to this hardiness and firmness of temper, and
remedies for curing him of the opposite weaknesses.
Yet the consequences might not be agreeable if the day of trial comes before:</p>
<p>he has completely learned his lesson
the remedy has had time to produce its proper effect
21 In the same way, our sensibility to the pleasures, amusements, and enjoyments of human life may offend by its:</p>
<p>excess, or
defect
Of the two, however, the excess seems less disagreeable than the defect.</p>
<p>To the spectator and to the person principally concerned, a strong propensity to joy is certainly more pleasing than a dull insensibility to the objects of amusement and diversion.
We are charmed with:
the gaiety of youth
the playfulness of childhood
But we soon grow weary of the flat and tasteless gravity which frequently accompanies old age.
This grave propensity is justly blamed as excessive when it is:
it is not restrained by the sense of propriety
it is unsuitable to the time, place, age or situation of the person
he neglects his interest or duty to indulge it
It is as hurtful to the individual and to society.
In most of such cases, however, what is chiefly to be found fault with is, not so much the strength of the propensity to joy, as the weakness of the sense of propriety and duty.
A young man is disliked as formal and pedantic if he
has no relish for the diversions and amusements that are natural and suitable to his age
talks of nothing but his book or his business
We give him no credit for his abstinence even from improper indulgences, to which he seems to have so little inclination.</p>
