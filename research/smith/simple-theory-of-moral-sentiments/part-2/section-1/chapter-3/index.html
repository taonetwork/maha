When there is no disapproval of the Erring Person&rsquo;s motives, there is no sympathy with the Sufferer&rsquo;s resentment</h3>
<p>15 A benefactor&rsquo;s action merits little reward if his good motives were misplaced, no matter how beneficial it was. The lack of a proper motive prevents us from having sympathy with his beneficiary&rsquo;s gratitude. In this case, little gratitude is due.</p>
<p>Likewise, an offender&rsquo;s bad action deserves no punishment if his motive was proper. This prevents us from having sympathy with the sufferer&rsquo;s resentment. All sorts of resentment seems unjust in this case.</p>
<p>16 If Rich Person A gives an estate Person B just because they have the same name and surname, then we feel that Person B is not obliged to give back a similar estate. Instead, we condemn Person A for his folly and this prevents us from entering into Person B&rsquo;s gratitude. We feel that we could conceive no great reverence for such a benefactor.</p>
<!-- We cannot sympathize with a benefactor's action if there is no propriety in his motives. This makes us less disposed to enter into the gratitude of his beneficiary. 
A very small return seems due to that foolish and profuse generosity which confers the greatest benefits from the most trivial motives. An example is giving an
 to a man merely because his name and surname happen to be the same with those of the giver.
Such services do not demand any proportional recompense. 

Our contempt for the benefactor's folly hinders us from thoroughly . His benefactor seems unworthy of it. 
 -->
<!-- Provided he treats his weak friend with kindness, we excuse him from many attentions which we demand to a worthier patron. -->
<p>Princes have heaped wealth, power, and honours on their favourites. They have seldom excited that attachment experienced by others who were more frugal in giving favours. The well-natured but injudicious prodigality of James I of Great Britain attached nobody to himself. Despite his social and harmless disposition, he appears to have lived and died without a friend. English nobility rather allied themselves with his more frugal and distinguishing son, despite his coldness and distant severity.</p>
<p>17 Wherever we approve of an injury done to a person, no matter how great, we can have no sympathy with his resentment. If Person A and B quarrel and we side with Person A, we cannot possibly enter into the resentment of Person B. Our sympathy with Person A hardens us against all fellow-feeling with Person B. We regard the former as in the right and the other as in the wrong.</p>
<!-- Whatever the other person may have suffered, it cannot displease or provoke us while it is no more than:
what we ourselves should have wished him to suffer
what our own sympathetic indignation would have prompted us to inflict on him -->
<p>We might have some compassion for the misery of an inhuman murderer about to be executed. However, we can have no fellow-feeling with his resentment against his prosecutor or judge. Their natural, just indignation against so vile a criminal is the most fatal to him. But it is impossible that we should be displeased with this indignation.</p>
