          <p>72 The Stoics said that there is no essential difference in the happiness in one permanent situation and another. If there were any difference, it was very little.</p>
<p>It was just enough to render that situation as objects of:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple preference, but not of earnest desire,</li>
<li>simple rejection, but not of earnest aversion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The certainty by which our happiness settles to match our permanent situation would make us think that the Stoics were correct.</p>
<p>Happiness consists in tranquility and enjoyment.
Without tranquility, there can be no enjoyment.
Where there is perfect tranquility, anything can be amusing.</p>
<p>But in every permanent situation, everyone&rsquo;s mind soon returns to its natural and usual state of tranquility.</p>
<ul>
<li>After a certain time in happiness, it falls back to that state.</li>
<li>After a certain time in unhappiness, it rises up to it.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Antoine Nompar de Caumont, duc de Lauzun -->
<p><img src="https://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/667px-antoine-nompar-de-caumont-duc-de-lauzun_par_belle.jpg" alt="Antoine Nompar de Caumont, duc de Lauzun"></p>
<p>After some time in the Bastille&rsquo;s solitary imprisonment, the fashionable and frivolous Count de Lauzun recovered enough tranquility to amuse himself with feeding a spider. A more philosophical mind would have recovered its tranquility faster and found a much better amusement in its own thoughts.</p>
<p>Human misery is from mistaking the impermanent as permanent.</p>
<p>73 <strong>The great source of human life&rsquo;s misery and disorders comes from over-rating the difference between one permanent situation and another.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avarice overrates the difference between poverty and riches.</li>
<li>Ambition overrates the difference between a private and a public station.</li>
<li>Vain-glory overrates the difference between obscurity and extensive reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The person under those extravagant feelings is actually miserable. He often disturbs the society&rsquo;s peace to arrive at that peace which he so foolishly admires.</p>
<h2 id="in-contrast-a-well-disposed-mind-is-equally-calm-cheerful-and-contented-in-all-ordinary-situations-none-of-those-situations-are-worth-violating-justice-or-prudence">In contrast, a well-disposed mind is equally calm, cheerful, and contented in all ordinary situations. None of those situations are worth violating justice or prudence.</h2>
<p>Some of those situations might be preferred to others.
But none of them deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardour which drives us to:
violate the rules of prudence or justice, or
corrupt the future tranquility of our minds by shame:</p>
<p>from the remembrance of our own folly, or
by remorse from the horror of our own injustice.
The man who attempts to change his situation plays the most unequal of all games of hazard wherever:
prudence does not direct it, and
justice does not permit it.
He stakes everything against scarce anything.</p>
<p>When the King of Epirus finished saying to his Favourite all his proposed conquests, the Favourite said:
&lsquo;And what does your Majesty propose to do then?
The King said:
&lsquo;I propose then to enjoy myself with friends and be good company over a bottle.
The Favourite replied:
&ldquo;and what hinders your Majesty from doing so now?&rsquo;
This may be applied to men in all the ordinary situations.</p>
<p>In the highest imaginary situation, our imagined pleasures are almost always the same with the actual pleasures in our lower station.</p>
<p>In the most humble station we may find:
except the frivolous pleasures of vanity and superiority
where there is only personal liberty, every other which the most exalted can afford;
The pleasures of vanity and superiority are seldom consistent with perfect tranquillity.
Perfect tranquility is the principle and foundation of all real and satisfactory enjoyment.
It is not certain that those real pleasures in the splendid situation, which we aim at, can be enjoyed with the same security as in the humble one, which we are very eager to abandon.
Most misfortunes arose from people not knowing:
when they were well and
when it was proper for them to sit still and be contented.
This is proven by:
examining history, and
recollecting what happened within your own experience.
attentively considering the conduct of those who were greatly unfortunate in life.
On a the tombstone of the man who had tried to mend a tolerable constitution by taking pills and potions was written:
&lsquo;I was well, I wished to be better.
Here I am; I may generally be applied with great justness to the distress of disappointed avarice and ambition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>74 In the misfortunes which can be remedied, most men do not readily or universally recover their natural and usual tranquility, as in misfortunes which cannot be remedied.</p>
<p>In irreparable misfortunes, it is chiefly in the first attack that we discover any difference between the sentiments of the wise man and the weak man.
Time is the great and universal comforter
In the end, it gradually composes the weak man to the same tranquility which the wise man had in the beginning.
The wise man&rsquo;s regard to his own dignity and manhood teaches himself have that tranquility.
The case of the man with the wooden leg is an obvious example of this.
In irreparable misfortunes caused by the death of children, friends and relations, even a wise man may indulge in some moderated sorrow for some time.
An affectionate, but weak woman, is often perfectly distracted on such occasions.
However, Time never fails to compose the weakest woman to the same tranquility as the strongest man.
In all calamities, a wise man tries to anticipate that future peace which he foresees to be restored to him after some time.</p>
<p>75In the misfortunes which have remedies which are not within the sufferer&rsquo;s reach, man is chiefly hindered from resuming his natural tranquility by his:</p>
<p>vain and fruitless attempts to restore himself to his former situation
continual anxiety for their success
repeated disappointments on their miscarriage
These frequently render him miserable for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>These do not disturb the man who had a greater irreparable misfortune.
The man who struggles the least, and most easily acquiesces in his fortune, quickly recovers his natural tranquility from the following situations:
the fall from royal favour to disgrace,
the fall from power to insignificancy,
the fall from riches to poverty,
the fall from liberty to confinement,
the fall from strong health to some chronic disease.
He surveys his disagreeable circumstances in the same light than how the most indifferent spectator does.</p>
<p>Faction, intrigue, and cabal, disturb the quiet of the unfortunate statesman.
Extravagant projects, visions of gold mines, interrupt the repose of the ruined bankrupt.
The prisoner, who is continually plotting to escape, cannot enjoy that careless security of a prison.
The physician&rsquo;s medicines are often the incurable patient&rsquo;s greatest torment.
To comfort Joanna of Castile after the death of her husband Philip, the monk told her about a King who was restored to life by the prayers of his afflicted queen 14 years after he died.
This legendary tale was unlikely to restore sedateness to Joanna.
She tried to repeat the same experiment hoping for the same success.
For a long time, she resisted the burial of her husband.
She soon after raised his body from the grave.
She attended it almost constantly herself.
She watched impatiently the happy moment when her wishes were to be gratified by the revival of her beloved Philip.*8
Self-command is often opposite to humanity
76Our sensibility to the feelings of others is the very principle on which the manhood of self-command is founded.</p>
<p>It is the very same principle or instinct which prompts us to compassion during our neighbour&rsquo;s misfortune.
In our own misfortune, it prompts us to restrain the miserable lamentations of our own sorrow.
It is the same principle or instinct which prompts us to:
congratulate his joy in his success
restrain our own joy&rsquo;s levity in our own success
In both cases, the propriety of our own feelings is exactly proportional to the force with which we enter into and conceive his feelings.</p>
<p>77 We naturally love the man of the most perfect virtue.</p>
<p>He most perfectly controls his own selfish feelings
He has the most exquisite sensibility to the original and to the sympathetic feelings of others.
We naturally love most the man who joins all the great and respectable virtues with all the soft, amiable, and gentle ones.</p>
<p>78 The person best fitted by nature for acquiring the great, awful, and respectable virtues is likewise best fitted for acquiring the soft, amiable, and gentle ones.</p>
<p>The man who feels the most for the feelings of others, is best fitted for acquiring the most complete control of his feelings.
The man of the most exquisite humanity, is naturally the most capable of acquiring the highest degree of self-command.
However, he may not always have acquired it.
He very frequently has not acquired it.
He may have lived too much in ease and tranquillity.
He may have never been exposed to:
the violence of faction or
the hardships and hazards of war
He may have never experienced:
the insolence of his superiors
the jealous and malignant envy of his equals, or
the pilfering injustice of his inferiors
When some accidental change of fortune exposes him to all these in old age, they make too great an impression on him.
He is fit for acquiring the most perfect self-command, but he never has had the opportunity of acquiring it.
Exercise and practice have been lacking.
Without these, no habit can ever be tolerably established.
Hardships, dangers, injuries, misfortunes, are the only masters under whom we can learn the exercise of this virtue.
But these are all masters to whom nobody willingly puts himself to school.</p>
<p>79 Humanity is a gentle virtue, self-command is an austere virtue.</p>
<p>Humanity is best cultivated in situations different from those for forming self-command.
The man who is at ease can best attend to the distress of others.
The man who is exposed to hardships must control his own feelings.
Humanity flourishes the most in:
the mild sunshine of undisturbed tranquillity, and
the calm retirement of philosophical leisure.
It is capable of the highest improvement.
But, in such situations, the greatest exertions of self-command have little exercise.
During war, faction, public tumult and confusion:
self-command:
prospers the most, and
can be cultivated most successfully.
but the strongest suggestions of humanity is frequently neglected
Every such neglect necessarily weakens the principle of humanity.
It is frequently a soldier&rsquo;s duty not to take, and sometimes his duty not to give quarter.
The humanity of the man who does this disagreeable duty several times will be greatly reduced.
For his own ease, he learns to make light of the misfortunes that he brings.
The sacred regard to life and property is the foundation of justice and humanity.
The situations which need the noblest exertions of self-command always reduce and often extinguish that sacred regard, by imposing the need to violate our neighbour&rsquo;s life and property.
Because of this, we frequently find men of great humanity who have little self-command.
The humane are indolent, irresolute, and easily disheartened from honourable pursuits by difficulty or danger.
On the contrary, we find men of the most perfect self-command not discouraged by difficulty or danger.
They are always ready for daring and desperate enterprises.
But at the same time, they seem to be hardened against all sense of justice or humanity.</p>
<p>80 In solitude, we tend to feel too strongly for whatever relates to ourselves.</p>
<p>We tend to over-rate:
the good offices we may have done, and
the injuries we may have suffered.
We tend to be:
too much elated by our own good fortune, and
too much dejected by our own bad fortune.
Our friend&rsquo;s conversation brings us to a better temper.
A stranger&rsquo;s conversation brings us to a still better temper.
The man within the breast is the abstract and ideal spectator of our sentiments and conduct.
It often requires to be awakened and put in mind of his duty by the presence of the real spectator.
We are likely to learn the most complete lesson of self-command always from the real spectator.
We can expect the least sympathy and indulgence from it.
81 Are you in adversity?</p>
<p>Do not mourn in the darkness of solitude.
Do not regulate your sorrow according to the indulgent sympathy of your intimate friends.
Return to the daylight of the world and society as soon as possible.
Live with strangers, with those who know nothing or care nothing about your misfortune.
Do not even shun the company of enemies.
Give yourself the pleasure of mortifying their malignant joy by:
making them feel how little you are affected by your calamity, and
how much you are above it.
82 Are you in prosperity?</p>
<p>Do not confine the enjoyment of your good fortune to:
your own house, and
the company of your:
own friends, and
flatterers, perhaps those who build on your fortune in the hopes of mending their own.
Frequent those who are independent of you.
They can value you only for your character and conduct and not for your fortune.
Do not seek, shun, intrude yourself into, or run away from your former superiors.
They may be hurt at finding you their equal or even their superior.
The impertinence of their pride might render their company too disagreeable.
But if it should not, be assured that it is the best company you can possibly keep.
If, by the simplicity of your unassuming demeanour, you can gain their favour and kindness, you may rest satisfied that:
you are modest enough
your head has been not turned by your good fortune
Factions tend to corrupt our moral feelings because it separates us from others
83 The propriety of our moral feelings is easily corrupted when the indulgent and partial spectator is near and the indifferent and impartial one is far.</p>
<p>84 Neutral nations are the only impartial spectators of the conduct of one independent nation towards another.</p>
<p>But they are placed so far that they are almost quite out of sight.
When two nations are in conflict, the citizen of each pays little regard to the feelings of foreign nations on his own conduct.
His whole ambition is to obtain his fellow-citizens&rsquo; approbation.
They are all animated by the same hostile passions which animate himself.
He can please them by enraging and offending their enemies.
The partial spectator is very near.
The impartial one is very far.
Therefore, in war and negotiation, the laws of justice are very seldom observed.
Truth and fair dealing are almost totally disregarded.
Treaties are violated.
The advantageous violation does not give any dishonour on the violator.
The ambassador who dupes a foreign minister is admired and applauded.
In all private transactions, the just man who disdains to take or give any advantage would be most beloved and esteemed.
In those public transactions he is regarded as:
a fool and an idiot, and
someone who does not understand his business.
He always incurs his fellow-citizens' contempt and sometimes their detestation.
In war, the laws of nations are frequently violated without the violator getting any considerable dishonour from his own fellow-citizens.
The violator only regards their judgments.
But most of those laws are laid down with very little regard to the most obvious rules of justice.
One of the most obvious rules of justice is that the innocent should not suffer or be punished for the guilty.
The innocent might be unable to help being somewhat connected or dependent on the guilty.
In the most unjust war, only the rulers are commonly guilty.
The subjects are almost always perfectly innocent.
However, whenever it suits a public enemy&rsquo;s convenience, the peaceful citizens' goods are seized at land and sea.
Their lands are laid waste.
Their houses are burnt.
They are murdered or captured if they resist.
All this conforms perfectly to &lsquo;the laws of nations&rsquo;.</p>
<p>85The animosity of hostile civil or ecclesiastical factions, is often more furious than the animosity of hostile nations.</p>
<p>Their conduct towards one another is often more atrocious.
The laws of faction have often been laid down by grave authors with less regard to the rules of justice than the laws of nations.
The most ferocious patriot never stated it as a serious question, whether faith should be kept with:
public enemies?
rebels?
heretics?
These are questions which have been often furiously agitated by celebrated civil and ecclesiastical doctors.
Rebels and heretics are those unlucky persons who have the misfortune of being the weaker party.
In a nation distracted by faction, there are very few who preserve their judgment untainted by the contagion.
They seldom amount to more than a solitary individual here and there.
He does not have any influence.
He is excluded by his own candour from the confidence of either party.
He is one of the most insignificant men in the society because he might be one of the wisest.
All such people are held in contempt and derision, frequently in detestation, by the furious zealots of both parties.
A true party-man hates and despises candour.
In reality, the virtue of candour effectively disqualifies him the best for the role of a party-man.
The real, revered, and impartial spectator, therefore, is at its farthest during the violence and rage of contending parties.
To them, no such spectator exists anywhere in the universe.
They impute all their own prejudices even to the great Judge of the universe.
They often view that Divine Being as animated by all their own vindictive and implacable passions.
Of all the corrupters of moral sentiments, therefore, faction and fanaticism have always been by far the greatest.</p>
<p>86 Our admiration for the man who continues to be firm under the heaviest and most unexpected misfortunes, always supposes that his sensibility to those misfortunes:</p>
<p>is very great
requires a very great effort to command
The man who was insensible to bodily pain, could deserve no applause from enduring the torture with perfect patience.</p>
<p>The man born without the natural fear of death, could claim no merit from preserving his coolness during the most dreadful dangers.
Seneca was a Stoical wise man who had such extravagant self command which was, in this respect, superior even to a god.
The security of the god came from nature, which had exempted Him from suffering.
But that the security of Seneca was his own benefit.
It was derived altogether from himself and from his own exertions.</p>
<p>87However, the sensibility of some men to some of the objects which immediately affect themselves, is sometimes so strong as to render all self-command impossible.</p>
<p>No sense of honour can control the fears of the man upon the approach of danger.
Such weakness of nerves might not be cured by gradual exercise and proper discipline.
Such weakness should never be trusted or employed.</p>
