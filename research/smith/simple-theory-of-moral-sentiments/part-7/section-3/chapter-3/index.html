          <!-- ## Introduction -->
<p>17 Moral systems based on feelings can be divided into two classes.</p>
<p>18</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>According to some, the principle of approbation is founded on a particular faculty of perception.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exerted by the mind at the view of actions or affections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some actions affect this faculty agreeably and are stamped as right, laudable, and virtuous.</li>
<li>Some actions affect it disagreeably and are stamped as wrong, blamable, and vicious.</li>
</ul>
<p>This feeling is called a <strong>moral sense</strong>. It is of a peculiar nature, distinct from every other and is the effect of a particular power of perception.</p>
<p>19</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>According to others, morality is not based on a moral sense, but on the fact that nature acts with the strictest economy all the time.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This economy naturally produces sympathy in the mind, which then leads to morality. <!-- many effects from one and the same cause. --></p>
<!--  is a power which has always been noticed.
The mind is manifestly endowed with it
They think the mind is sufficient to account for all the effects ascribed to sympathy. -->
<br>
<h3 id="the-moral-sense">The Moral Sense</h3>
<p>20 I. Dr. Hutcheson took great pains to prove that morality came from a moral sense and not from self-love nor reason.</p>
<!-- He also demonstrated that it could not arise from reason.
He thought that nothing remained but to suppose it to be a peculiar kind of faculty. -->
<p>But he only arrived at such a moral sense because he took morality away from self-love and reason. This led him to say that Nature endowed the human mind with this faculty. <!--  to produce this one important effect. --></p>
<!-- When  were excluded, he did not know any other known faculty of the mind to answer this purpose. -->
<p>21 <!-- He called this new power of perception a moral sense. --> He supposed this moral sense to be analogous to the external senses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our external senses give us an idea of an object&rsquo;s sound, taste, smell, and colour.</li>
<li>This moral sense, to Hutcheson, gives us an idea of an action&rsquo;s virtue or vice, propriety or impropriety.</li>
</ul>
<!-- in a certain way, the human mind's various affections appear to be: -->
<!-- - amiable and odious,
right and wrong. -->
<p>22 According to this system, the mind derives all its simple ideas from two kinds of senses:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The direct or antecedent senses</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These derived the perception that were not antecedent to any other. Sounds and colours were objects of the direct senses. To hear a sound or to see a colour does not presuppose the antecedent perception of any other quality or object.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>The reflex or consequent senses</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These derived the perception that was the antecedent perception of some other perception. Harmony and beauty were objects of the reflex senses.</p>
<p>In order to perceive a sound&rsquo;s harmony or a colour&rsquo;s beauty, we must first perceive the sound or the colour.
The moral sense was considered as a reflex sense.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Hutcheson, the faculty which Mr. Locke called reflection, and from which he derived the simple ideas of the human mind&rsquo;s passions and emotions, was a direct internal sense.</p>
<p>That faculty by which we perceived the beauty or deformity, the virtue or vice of those passions and emotions, was a reflex, internal sense.</p>
<p>23 Dr. Hutcheson tried to support this doctrine by showing:</p>
<ul>
<li>that it was agreeable to the analogy of nature, and</li>
<li>that the mind had other reflex senses exactly similar to the moral sense, such as:
<ul>
<li>a sense of beauty in external objects,</li>
<li>a public sense, by which we sympathize with others,</li>
<li>a sense of shame and honour, and</li>
<li>a sense of ridicule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>24 But despite all his efforts to prove that morality is based in a moral sense, he acknowledges some refutations to this doctrine.</p>
<p>He allows the qualities which belong to the objects of any sense, cannot be ascribed to the sense itself, without the greatest absurdity.</p>
<p>There is no sense for:</p>
<ul>
<li>black or white,</li>
<li>loud or not loud, or</li>
<li>sweet or bitter</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, according to him, there is no:</p>
<ul>
<li>sense of virte or sense of vice, and</li>
<li>sense of good or sense of evil.</li>
</ul>
<p>These qualities belong to the objects of those faculties, not to the faculties themselves.</p>
<p>It would be strange for a person to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>cruelty and injustice as the highest virtues, and</li>
<li>equity and humanity as the most pitiful vices.</li>
</ul>
<!-- It would be as strange, surprising, and unnatural in itself.
But it could not be denominated vicious or morally evil without the greatest absurdity. -->
<p>25 If we saw any man loudly applauding a barbarous execution ordered by a tyrant, we would regard him as most morally evil, even if his applause only showed that his moral faculties were depraved as to see a horrid action as something noble and magnanimous. The tyrant would even be more excusable.</p>
<!-- I imagine that our heart would forget its sympathy with the sufferer for a while.
We would feel only horror and detestation, at the thought of so execrable a wretch.
We should abominate him even more than the tyrant who might be goaded on by the strong passions of jealousy, fear, and resentment. -->
<!-- But the spectator's sentiments would appear without cause or motive.
It would therefore be perfectly detestable.
Our hearts would reject this perversion of sentiment with the most hatred and indignation.
We would consider his mind as the very last and most dreadful stage of moral depravity. -->
<p>26 On the contrary, correct moral sentiments naturally appear laudable and morally good in some degree.</p>
<p>A man whose censure and applause are always very accurately suited to the object even seems to deserve moral approbation.
We admire his moral sentiments' delicate precision.
They lead our own judgments.
They even excite our wonder and applause because of their uncommon and surprising justness.
We cannot be always sure that such a person&rsquo;s conduct would correspond to the precision of his judgments on the conduct of others.
Virtue requires habit and resolution of mind, as well as delicacy of sentiment.
Unfortunately, the habit and resolution are sometimes lacking where delicacy is most perfect.
This disposition of mind may sometimes have imperfections.
However, it is not grossly criminal.
It is the happiest foundation on which the superstructure of perfect virtue can be built.
Many men mean very well and seriously do their duty, despite the coarseness of their moral sentiments.</p>
<p>27 The principle of approbation is not founded on any power of perception analogous to the external senses.</p>
<p>However, it may still be founded on a peculiar sentiment which answers only this one particular purpose.
It may be pretended that approbation and disapprobation are feelings which arise in the mind on the view of characters and actions.
Resentment might be called a sense of injuries.
Gratitude may be called a sense of benefits.
These may very properly receive the name of a sense of right and wrong, or of a moral sense.</p>
<p>28 This is not liable to the same objections as the objections against the previous moral sense.</p>
<p>However, it is exposed to other objections equally unanswerable.</p>
<p>29 The variations of any emotion still keeps the general features of the main emotion.
These general features are always more striking than any of its variations.
Thus, anger is a particular kind of emotion.
Its general features are always more distinguishable than all its variations.
Anger against a man is somewhat different from anger against a woman.
Anger against a woman is again different from anger against a child.
In each of those three cases, the general passion of anger is modified by its object.
This is easily observable by the attentive.
A very delicate attention is needed to discover their variations.
Everybody notices the general features.
Nobody observes their variations.
Therefore, if approbation and disapprobation were distinct kinds of emotions like gratitude and resentment, they should retain their general features in all their variations.
Those general features mark it as such a particular kind of emotion, clear, plain, and easily distinguishable.
But in fact, it happens quite otherwise.
If we attend to what we really feel when we approve or disapprove, we shall find that:
our emotion in one case is often totally different from that in another, and
no common features can be discovered between them.
Thus, our approbation on a tender, delicate, and humane sentiment, is quite different from our approbation of a great, daring, and magnanimous sentiment.
Our approbation of both may be perfect on different occasions.
We are softened by the one and elevated by the other.
There is no resemblance between the emotions they excite in us.
But according to the system that I have been trying to establish, this must be the case.
In those two cases, the emotions of the person we approve of are opposite.
Our approbation arises from sympathy with those opposite emotions.
What we feel on one occasion cannot resemble what we feel on the other.
This could not happen if approbation:
arose from a view of the sentiments it observes, like any other passion arises from the view of its object, and
consisted in a peculiar emotion which had nothing in common with the sentiments we approved of.
The same thing is true with regard to disapprobation.
Our horror for cruelty does not resemble our contempt for mean-spiritedness.
We feel a different kind of discord from those two vices, between our mind and the mind of the person having those sentiments.</p>
<p>30 In my system, a person&rsquo;s passions are moral if those passions are moral to ourselves. How can we make a moral opinion on the moral opinions of others?</p>
<!-- The mind's passions that are approved or disapproved of appear morally good or evil, and
that to our natural sentiments, proper and improper approbation are stamped with the same characters.

According to this system, how do we approve or disapprove of proper or improper approbation? -->
<!-- I think that there is only one reasonable answer to this question. -->
<p>When his moral opinion <!-- our neighbour's approbation on a third person's conduct --> coincides with our own, we approve of his opinion.</p>
<!--  approbation.
We consider it as morally good. -->
<p>When it does not coincide with our own feelings, we disapprove of it.</p>
<!-- We consider it as morally evil. -->
<p>In this case, the coincidence or opposition of feelings between the observers and the person observed, constitutes moral opinon.</p>
<!-- If it does so in this one case, why not in every other?
Or why do we need to imagine a new power of perception to account for those sentiments? -->
<p>Why do we need to create a new moral sense when morality is already sourced from the match or mismatch of feelings?</p>
<p>31 I object against any moral system that is based on a unique feeling, separate from other feelings.</p>
<p>It would mean that Providence created this feeling to govern human nature has been unnoticed that it has not gotten a name in any language.</p>
<!-- every account of the principle of approbation which makes it depend on a peculiar sentiment, distinct from every other. -->
<ul>
<li>The word &lsquo;moral sense&rsquo; is very new and is not yet part of the English language.</li>
</ul>
<!-- It cannot yet be considered as part of the English tongue.
The word 'approbation' has been appropriated to denote anything of this kind, within these few years.
We approve of whatever is entirely to our satisfaction:
the form of a building
the contrivance of a machine
the flavour of a dish of meat -->
<ul>
<li>The word &lsquo;conscience&rsquo; does not immediately denote any moral sense though it supposes the existence of such a faculty.<!--  by which we approve or disapprove -->.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our conscience shows our awareness in acting to the directions of a moral sense, which have all our feelings as its subjects.</p>
<p>Those feelings have made themselves considerable enough to get names such as &lsquo;love&rsquo;, &lsquo;hatred&rsquo;, &lsquo;sorrow&rsquo;, etc. It is surprising that the sovereign of them has been so little heeded, that only a few philosophers have given it a name.</p>
<p>32 According to my system, our moral opinion is based on our feelings which are then derived from four sources:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From our sympathy with the <strong>actor&rsquo;s motives</strong> [This is the first law of value in Pantrynomics]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From our sympathy with the gratitude of those who <strong>receive the benefit of his actions</strong>. [This is the third law of value in Pantrynomics]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From our sympathy with the actor&rsquo;s conduct matching with the <strong>general rules</strong>. [This is the fourth law of value in Pantrynomics]  <!-- by which those two sympathies generally act --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From our sympathy with the <strong>utility</strong> the actor&rsquo;s conduct and how it benefits a person or others. [This is the second law of value in Pantrynomics]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!--   its When we consider such actions as part of a system of behaviour which tends to promote the happiness of the individual or the society, they derive a beauty from this utility like that of any well-contrived machine. -->
<!-- 1 value
2 dharma
3 spread
4 regulate -->
<p>Is there any other source besides these four? If there is, I can ascribe the fifth source to be a moral sense or any other peculiar faculty, provided that this sense or faculty can be precisely defined.</p>
<!-- After deducting all that proceeds from any of these four principles, I should be glad to know what remains.
I shall freely allow this overplus to be ascribed to 
anybody will ascertain  what this overplus is. -->
<p>If there is such a moral sense, then we should be able to feel it separated from every other sense, just as we feel joy, sorrow, hope, and fear, purely and unmixed with any other emotion.</p>
<p>However, I have never heard of any instance in which this principle exerted itself alone and unmixed with:</p>
<ul>
<li>sympathy or antipathy,</li>
<li>gratitude or resentment,</li>
<li>a sense of agreement or disagreement with an established rule, or</li>
<li>that general taste for beauty in living and nonliving things.</li>
</ul>
<!-- and order which is excited by inanimated as well as by animated objects -->
<blockquote>
<p>*To Social Superphysics, this moral sense is the invisible hand. In Buddhism, it is prajna-paramita which lets conscious entities perceive the dharma.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- 33 There is another system which bases the origin of our moral feelings on sympathy, different from mine.

This system:
- places virtue in utility, and
accounts for the spectator's pleasure from his sympathy with the happiness of the people experiencing the utility of any quality.

This sympathy is different from our sympathy with the agent's motives and the gratitude of those benefited by his actions.

It is the same principle that causes us to approve of a well-contrived machine.

But no machine can be the object of those sympathies with the agent's motives and the gratitude of those benefited by his actions.

I have already mentioned this system in Part 4.
