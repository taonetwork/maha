      <description>In Glasgow, Smith was a teacher and a learner. The conditions of time and place were most favourable for his instruction.
Had he remained at Oxford, he would probably never have been an economist. had he not spent so many of his best years in Glasgow, he would never have been such an eminent one. He grew into a great economist amid:
 the thickening problems of the Clyde’s rising trade, and the daily discussions they occasioned among the town’s enterprising and intelligent merchants.</description>

      <description>1740-1746. Aet.17-23
Smith left Scotland for Oxford in June 1740, riding the whole way on horseback. He told Samuel Rogers many years afterwards that, from the moment he crossed the Border he was much struck with:
 the richness of the country he was entering, and the great superiority of its agriculture over that of his own country.  Scotch agriculture was not born in 1740, even in the Lothians. The country everywhere was very bare and waste.</description>

      <title>Early Days at Kirkcaldy</title>

      <description>1723-1737 Adam Smith was born at Kirkcaldy, in the county of Fife, Scotland, on June 5, 1723. His father was also named Adam Smith who was:
 a native of Aberdeen, a Writer to the Signet, a Judge Advocate for Scotland, and a Comptroller of the Customs in the Kirkcaldy district.  His mother was Margaret, daughter of John Douglas of Strathendry, a considerable landed proprietor in Fife.
Little is known of his father.</description>

      <description>During his stay in Glasgow, Smith maintained intimate relations with his old friends in Edinburgh.
 He often visited them by coach even if the journey took 13 hours before the road was improved. He spent most of his many successive vacations among them. He actively promoted some literary, scientific, and social improvement projects then widespread in Scotland. His patron was Henry Home.  In 1752, Mr. Home was raised to the bench as Lord Kames.</description>

      <description>When Smith left Glasgow, his mother and cousin went back again to Kirkcaldy. He remained with them there for the next 11 years.
Hume thought that the countryside was unsuitable for a man of letters. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to move to Edinburgh. But Smith had everything he needed in Kirkcaldy:
 his work his mother his books his daily walks in the sea breeze  Edinburgh always in the offing as a place of occasional resort.</description>

      <description>The new edition of the Theory was Smith’s last published work. A French newspaper, the Moniteur Universelle of Paris, announced on March 11, 1790 that Smith would do a critical examination of Montesquieu’s Esprit des Lois.
It speculated that the work would make an epoch in the history of politics and of philosophy.
But there is no evidence that he intended to publish a separate work on Montesquieu. Before March 1790, his strength seems to have been much wasted.</description>

      <description>At Oxford Smith returned to Scotland probably to get a Scotch university chair eventually. But he thought in the meantime to get a job as a traveling tutor to the Duke of Buccleugh, who was a ranking and wealthy young man. It was then a much-desired and a highly-paid job.
He afterwards gave up his chair for that job. While looking for that job, he stayed at home with his mother in Kirkcaldy.</description>

      <description>Smith arrived in London early in November and remained there for the next six months. The body of his unfortunate pupil, which he brought over with him, was ultimately buried in the family vault at Dalkeith, (Dr. Norman Macleod and Mr. Steel)
but the interment there does not seem to have taken place immediately after the arrival from France, for the London journals, which announce the Duke of Buccleugh&amp;rsquo;s landing at Dover on November 1, mention his presence at the Guildhall with his stepfather, Mr.</description>

      <description>1737-1740 Smith entered Glasgow College in October 1737 and remained there until spring 1740. Back then, the arts curriculum spanned over five sessions. Thus, Smith did not complete the course required for a degree.
He attended three sessions, going through the classes of Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and Moral Philosophy. These classes drew students from afar and had remarkable intellectual activity.
Dr. A. Carlyle came to Glasgow College formoved his divinity classes after he had finished his arts course at Edinburgh.</description>

      <description>1776 After the publication of his book in the beginning of March, Smith still dallied in London, without going to see Hume in Edinburgh then bring him to London.
But some hope seems to have been entertained of Hume coming up even without Smith&amp;rsquo;s persuasion and escort.
Bishop John Home thought so. He was in London and was in correspondence with Hume. But Hume wrote no, in a letter on April 12.</description>
