In modern times, it is decided by the magistrate, lest the society should be disturbed by every person taking justice at his own hands.
The sovereign is bound to demand satisfaction for the following offences:

      <description>It is not easy to determine how far a nation may push its resentment against another nation which has injured it.
The practice of ancient and modern nations differs extremely. In general, resentment is necessary and just when an injury:
 is clearly and distinctly done, or is plainly intended and satisfaction refused.  There are a few cases in which it is lawful even without satisfaction being demanded.
If a robber intended to kill you, it would be quite lawful for you to do all you could to prevent him.</description>

      <description>Third, we next show what is due to neutral nations from the belligerent powers.
The rule of justice with respect to neutral nations is, that they should suffer no injury as they have offended no party.
In a war between France and England, the Dutch should have the liberty of trading to both countries, as in peacetime, because they have injured neither. They can trade to them freely unless when they:</description>

      <description>When nations came to have a lot of business one with another, it became necessary to send messengers between them. They were the first ambassadors.
Anciently, there was little commerce between nations and ambassadors were only sent on particular occasions.
