          <p>We have considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the dissolution of small states was brought about, and</li>
<li>what form of government succeeded them,</li>
<li>how an imperial government was introduced into conquering republics, and</li>
<li>what kind of administration this was.</li>
</ul>
<p>We now show how this military monarchy was dissolved, like every state and constitution.</p>
<p>During the imperial governments at Rome, their arts and commerce were improved.
The people become acquainted with arts, commerce and consequently, domestic luxury.
They became less fond of going out to war.
Besides, the government found that it would hurt its revenue to call out those employed in manufactures.
If barbarous nations were near, they can employ them as soldiers at an easier rate.
At the same time, it would not hurt their own industry.
Sensible of these things, the Romans recruited their armies in Germany, Britain, and the northern barbarous countries which bordered on the Roman Empire.
They had the liberty of recruiting in these countries in the same way that the Dutch did in Scotland before the beginning of the last war1.
After this practice had gone on for some time, they would find for several reasons that it would be much easier to:
make a bargain with the chieftains of these barbarous nations whom they employed, and
give him so much money to lead out men to expeditions.</p>
<p>Supposing then an institution of this kind, the barbarous chieftain possessed the whole military authority of the people for whom he fought.
Whenever the government in the least offended him, he could turn his arms against those who employed him, and make himself master of their country.
All the western provinces were taken possession of much in this way.
After they had by their practice given such invitations to the inroad of barbarians, we find that most of the Roman provinces were infested by them.
In this country, the Romans built a wall and kept garrisons to secure their province from the pillagers of the north.
The garrisons which secured this station were called away to the defence of Gaul, which at that time was also infested.
The Britons then got leave to shake off the Roman yoke.
But it could be no advantage to the Romans to give any country in Britain its liberty.
It was no favour done it to have no protection from Rome, which the province in reality wanted to have continued.
The Romans meant that they should defend themselves, as they were, for some time, to be otherwise employed.
However, the Britons did not like the proposal.
They resolved to invite a body of Saxons to their relief.
Hengist and Hursa came with a considerable army and entirely drove out the Romans1.
They found themselves masters of the whole country.
They took possession of it and founded the Saxon Heptarchy.
The Western European Empire in this way.
Military monarchy came to ruin.
In the last 150 years of the Roman Empire, this custom of recruiting in barbarous nations was carried on.
Many of their chieftains had greatly raised themselves.
Patricius Ã†lias1 under Honorius, and many others, acquired great power.
In the same way, all the Asiatic governments were dissolved.
Their soldiers were hired from Tartary, arts and manufactures were carried on, the people made more by their trades than by going to war.
The East India trade which Italy and some other nations carried on by the Red Sea had rendered them very opulent.
Every nation as well as Rome was willing to make a bargain with the neighbouring barbarous princes to defend them.
This proved the ruin of the government.</p>
