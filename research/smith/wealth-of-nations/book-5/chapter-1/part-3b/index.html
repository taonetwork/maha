          <p>81 A big revenue might be gained but probably not near as the projectors of this plan have supposed.</p>
<p>The plan itself is liable to very important objections:</p>
<p>82 1. If the turnpike tolls should be a resource for supplying state exigencies, the tolls would be increased as those exigencies required.</p>
<pre><code>According to British policy, they would probably be increased very fast.
    This great revenue would probably encourage the government to very frequently recur to this resource.
It is doubtful whether £500,000 could be saved out of the present tolls.
    £1 million might be saved if the turnpike tolls were doubled.
    £2 million would be saved if they were tripled.
    This great revenue might be levied without the appointment of a single new officer to collect and receive it.
    The turnpike tolls would be continually increased this way.
    They would soon become a very great encumbrance on the country's inland commerce.
    The domestic transportation costs of all heavy goods would soon increase so much.
        The market for all such goods would be soon narrowed so much.
            Their production would be discouraged.
        The most important branches of the domestic industry would be annihilated.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>83 A tax on carriages according to weight is a very equal tax for road repairs.</p>
<p>But it is a very unequal one for any other purpose, such as for supplying state exigencies.
A tax for road repair requires each carriage to pay exactly for the wear and tear that carriage brings to the roads.
A tax for the state exigencies requires each carriage to pay for the state exigency on top of that wear and tear.
The turnpike toll raises the price of goods according to their weight and not their value.
It is chiefly paid by the consumers of coarse and bulky goods and not by those of precious and light commodities.
Therefore, a tax for state exigencies would be chiefly supplied by the poor, not the rich.
It would be at the expence of those who are least able to supply it, not of those who are most able.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>84 3. If government neglected the repair of the high roads, it would be more difficult to compel the proper application of any part of the turnpike tolls.</p>
<pre><code>A large revenue might thus be levied on the people without it being used for road repair.
The meanness and poverty of the trustees of turnpike roads make it sometimes difficult to oblige them to repair their wrong.
    Their wealth and greatness would render it ten times more so in this case.
</code></pre>
<p>85 In France, the funds for repairing high roads are under the executive power.</p>
<pre><code>Those funds consist in:
    a certain number of days labour which most countryside people in Europe are obliged to give for highway repair
    a part of the state's general revenue which the king allocates for road repairs.
</code></pre>
<p>86 By the ancient law of France and other parts of Europe, the labour of the people of the countryside was under a local or provincial magistrate.</p>
<pre><code>It was not immediately dependent on the king's council.
But by the present practice, the following are entirely under an intendant's management:
    the people's labour, and
    whatever other fund the king assigns to repair the high roads in any province.
The intendant is an officer appointed by the king's council.
    He receives orders from it and is in constant correspondence with it.
</code></pre>
<p>In the progress of despotism, the executive power gradually absorbs every other power in the state.</p>
<pre><code>It assumes to itself the management of every branch of public revenue.
Post-roads are roads used for the communication between the principal towns.
    In France, the great post-roads are generally kept in good order.
    In some provinces, they are even much superior to most English turnpike roads.
Cross-roads are the most common roads in the countryside.
    They are entirely neglected.
    In many places, they are absolutely impassable by heavy carriage.
    In some places, it is even dangerous to travel on them on horseback.
        Mules are the only safe transportation.
</code></pre>
<p>The proud minister of an ostentatious court may frequently take pleasure in executing a magnificent work, such as a great highway.</p>
<pre><code>It is frequently seen by the principal nobility.
    Their applauses flatter the minister's vanity and even support his interest at court.
But a great magistrate is not interested in building many little works which:
    have no great appearance, or
    cannot excite any traveler's admiration even if they are extremely useful.
Under such an administration, such small works are almost always neglected.
</code></pre>
<p>87 In China and other Asian governments, the executive power manages the repair of high roads and the maintenance of navigable canals.</p>
<pre><code>Those repairs and maintenance are constantly recommended in the instructions given to each provincial governor.
    His attention to these instructions regulates the court's judgement on his conduct.
Those public works are very much attended to in those countries, particularly in China.
    It was pretended that the high roads and most especially the navigable canals very much exceed those in Europe.
    The accounts of those works transmitted to Europe were generally drawn up by weak and wondering travelers, frequently by stupid and lying missionaries.
    They would perhaps not appear to be so wonderful if:
        they were examined by more intelligent eyes, and
        their accounts were reported by more faithful witnesses.
Bernier's account of similar works in India falls very much short of what was reported by other travelers.
    They were more disposed to the marvelous than he was.
Like in France, those countries might attend to the great roads while neglect all the rest.
    The great roads are likely to be the subjects of conversation at the court and in the capital.
In China, India, and other Asian governments, the sovereign's revenue arises from a land-tax or land-rent.
    It rises or falls with the rise and fall of the produce of the land.
</code></pre>
<p>The sovereign&rsquo;s great interest is his revenue.</p>
<pre><code>In such countries, it is necessarily and immediately connected with:
    the cultivation of the land, and
    the greatness and value of its produce.
To render that produce as great and valuable as possible, it is necessary to:
    provide it with an extensive a market as possible, and
    establish the freest, easiest, and least expensive communication within the country.
        It can be only done by the best roads and navigable canals.
</code></pre>
<p>In Europe, the sovereign&rsquo;s revenue does not arise chiefly from a land-tax or land-rent.</p>
<pre><code>In all the great European kingdoms, most of it may ultimately depend on the produce of the land.
    But that dependency is not so immediate nor so evident.
In Europe, the sovereign does not feel so directly called on to:
    increase the amount and value of the produce of the land,
    maintain good roads and canals to provide the most extensive market for that produce.
It might be true that in some parts of Asia, this public police is very properly managed by the executive power.
    Presently, it is improbable that it could be managed tolerably by the executive power in any part of Europe.
</code></pre>
<p>88 A local or provincial revenue is managed by a local or provincial administration.</p>
<pre><code>A state revenue must be managed by the executive power.
The following public works are always better maintained by a local or public revenue:
    Those which cannot maintain themselves, and
    Those which benefits are confined to a district.
Were the streets of London to be lit and paved at the national expence, could they would be so well lit and paved as at present, at so small an expence?
    Currently, the expence is raised by a local tax on the people of each London street, parish, or district.
    If they were paid from the national revenue, it would be raised by a tax on all citizens.
        Most of them would derive no benefit from the lighting and paving of those streets.
</code></pre>
<p>89 The abuses of the local and provincial administration on a local and provincial revenue may appear enormous.</p>
<pre><code>In reality, they are almost always very trifling compared to the abuses of the national revenue of a great empire.
Local and provincial abuses are much more easily corrected.
Under the local or provincial justices of the peace in Great Britain, people in the countryside are obliged to give six days labour for highway repairs.
    It is not always very judiciously applied.
    But it is rarely exacted with any cruelty or oppression.
In France under the intendants, the application is not always more judicious.
    The exaction is frequently the most cruel and oppressive.
    Such Corvées are one of the principal instruments of tyranny of those officers.
