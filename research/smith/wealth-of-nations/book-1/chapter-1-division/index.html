          <p>1 Division of labour causes improvements in:</p>
<ul>
<li>productivity, and
<ul>
<li>The greatest improvement is in this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the skill, dexterity, and judgment in work.</li>
</ul>
<p>2 The effects of division of labour is carried furthest in very trifling manufactures. These manufactures:</p>
<ul>
<li>supply the small wants of a few people</li>
<li>have a few workers who can often be:
<ul>
<li>collected into the same workhouse, and</li>
<li>placed under the spectator&rsquo;s view.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Great manufactures supply the great wants of the people. These have so many workers that it is impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse.</p>
<p>Thus in great manufactures, the work may be divided into more parts than in trifling manufactures.</p>
<p>But the division is:</p>
<ul>
<li>not as obvious, and</li>
<li>has been much less observed.</li>
</ul>
<p>3 An example of a very trifling manufacture is pin-making. The division of labour in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>has been noticed very often, and</li>
<li>has made pin-making a distinct trade.</li>
</ul>
<p>A worker probably might not be able to make one pin in a day if he is not educated in:</p>
<ul>
<li>the pin-making business, and</li>
<li>the use of pin-making machinery.</li>
</ul>
<p>These were probably invented by the same division of labour.
pinmaking</p>
<p>The whole work of pin-making is now a peculiar trade.</p>
<p>It is divided into branches.
Most of these branches are likewise peculiar trades.
One man draws out the wire.
Another straights it.
A third cuts it.
A fourth points it.
A fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head.
Making the head needs two or three distinct operations.
Putting it on is a peculiar business.
Whitening the pins is another.
Put them into the paper is even a trade by itself.
In this way, the important business of making a pin is divided into around 18 distinct operations.
In some factories, all are performed by distinct hands.
In others, the same man might perform two or three of them.
I have seen a small factory of this kind where only 10 men were employed.
Some of them performed two or three distinct operations.
They were:
very poor, and
indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery
But they could make around 12 pounds of pins in a day.
A pound has over 4,000 middle-sized pins.
Therefore, those persons could make over 48,000 pins in a day.
Each person makes 10% of 48,000 pins or 4,800 pins per day.
But if they worked separately and independently without being educated in pin-making, they certainly could have made 20 (0.4% of what they we capable of together) or one pin (0.02%) in a day individually.
4 The effects of the division of labour in other arts and manufactures are similar to those in this very trifling one, even if the labour in many of them might not be capable of:</p>
<p>being so much subdivided, nor
being so much reduced to such simple operations.
Nevertheless, the division of labour creates a proportional increase in the productivity of labour in every art as it is introduced.</p>
<p>This increase in productivity then creates the separation of different trades and employments.
This separation too is generally carried furthest in the most advanced countries.
Generally, the work of one man in a rude state of society is the work of several men in an improved one.
In every improved society:
the farmer is generally just a farmer, and
the manufacturer is just a manufacturer.
The labour needed to produce any manufacture is almost always divided among many hands.</p>
<p>So many different trades are employed in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactures:
the growers of the flax and the wool,
the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or
the dyers and dressers of the cloth!
The nature of agriculture does not allow:</p>
<p>so many subdivisions of labour, nor
so complete a separation of one business from another, as in manufactures.
It is impossible to entirely separate the grazier&rsquo;s business from the wheat-farmer&rsquo;s business.
But the carpenter&rsquo;s trade is commonly separated from the smith&rsquo;s trade.
The spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver.
But the ploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the wheat, are often the same.
It is impossible for one man to be constantly employed in any agricultural work because they are seasonal.</p>
<p>The improvement of productivity in agriculture does not always keep pace with the improvement of productivity in manufactures because of the impossibility of completely separating the branches of agricultural labour.
The most opulent nations generally excel in agriculture and manufactures.
But they are more distinguished by their manufacturing superiority.
Their lands are generally better cultivated.
They produce more, relative to natural fertility of the ground, because of the increased labour and expence applied on them.
But this increased produce is seldom much more than the increased labour and expence.
In agriculture, the labour of a rich country is not always much more productive than that of a poor country.
At least, it is never much more productive as in manufactures.
Therefore, a rich country&rsquo;s wheat will not always be cheaper than a poor country&rsquo;s wheat.</p>
<p>The wheat of Poland is as cheap as the wheat of France of the same quality, despite the superior opulence and improvement of France.
The wheat of France usually has the same price as English wheat of the same quality, even if France is poorer than England.
However, the wheat lands of England are better cultivated than those of France, and
the wheat lands of France are much better cultivated than those of Poland.
A poor country might be able to rival a rich country in the cheapness and quality of its wheat.</p>
<p>But it cannot compete in its manufactures, unless those manufactures suit the soil, climate, and situation of the rich country.
French silks are better and cheaper than English silks because the silk manufacture suits the climate of France better.
There are currently high duties on silk importation.</p>
<p>But England&rsquo;s hardware and coarse woollens are far superior to those of France.
They are much cheaper with the same quality.
Poland only has coarse household manufactures which are used locally.
Productivity is increased by dexterity, time savings, and machines</p>
