          <h2 id="the-weakness-of-the-king-conservatives-led-to-the-rise-of-the-free-traders-liberals">The Weakness of the King (Conservatives) Led to the Rise of the Free Traders (Liberals)</h2>
<p>9 The kings who hated their barons gave the most liberal grants to their burghs.</p>
<p>For example, King John of England was a most munificent benefactor to his towns.</p>
<p>Philip 1st of France lost all authority over his barons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Louis 6th was the son of Philip 1st</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Father Daniel, towards the end of the reign of Philip 1st, Louis 6th consulted with the bishops on how to restrain the great lords. They had two proposals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new order of jurisdiction by establishing magistrates and a town council in every big town in his territory.</li>
<li>Form a new militia made up of the townspeople under the command of their own magistrates, to assist the king.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This period marks the institution of the magistrates and councils of French cities.</strong></p>
<p>During the unprosperous reigns of the princes of the house of Swabia:</p>
<ul>
<li>most of the German free towns received their first privileges, and</li>
<li>the famous Hanseatic league first became formidable.</li>
</ul>
<p>10 The urban militia was not inferior to the rural militia of the great lords.</p>
<ul>
<li>They could be more readily assembled which gave them an advantage over the militia of the lords.</li>
</ul>
<p>In countries where the sovereign lost his whole authority, such as in Italy and Switzerland, the cities became independent republics.</p>
<p>The sovereign there lost his authority due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the distance of the cities from the seat of government,</li>
<li>the natural strength of the country itself, or</li>
<li>some other reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those cities conquered all the nobility in their neighbourhood. They obliged the nobility to pull down their castles and live in the city.</p>
<p>This is how the republic of Berne and other Swiss cities came to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Except for Venice, this is also how all the considerable Italian republics were formed*.</li>
<li>So many Italian republics arose and perished between the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 16th century.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>*Translator&rsquo;s note: This is similar to how the Roman Empire collapsed under the competition of the Germanic tribes</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3 id="the-origin-of-representation-in-parliaments">The Origin of Representation in Parliaments</h3>
<p>11 In countries where the sovereignâ€™s authority was never destroyed, such as in France or England, the cities had no opportunity to become independent.</p>
<p>However, they became so big that the sovereign could not impose taxes besides the stated tax-farm, without their own consent. They were instead called on to send deputies to the general assembly<!--  of the states of the kingdom -->. Those deputies:</p>
<ul>
<li>joined the clergy and the barons to grant extraordinary aid to the king on urgent occasions</li>
<li>were employed by the king as a counter-balance to the great lords in those assemblies.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the origin of the burgh representation in all the great European monarchies.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="urban-development-outpaced-rural-development">Urban Development Outpaced Rural Development</h3>
<p>12 In this way, order, good government, liberty, and security were established in cities when the countryside was still exposed to violence.</p>
<p>The rural areas fell to poverty in order not to tempt their feudal oppressors.</p>
<!-- men in the countryside were defenceless.
    They naturally contented themselves with their necessary subsistence because acquiring more might tempt their oppressors' injustice. -->
<p>On the contrary, the men in the cities were secure and were able to better their condition and acquire life&rsquo;s conveniences and elegancies. This led to urban industry long before the development of rural industry.</p>
<p>A poor cultivator, oppressed with serfdom, will hide his little stock from his master.</p>
<ul>
<li>He would run away to a town at the first opportunity.</li>
<li>Back then, the law was so indulgent to townspeople in order to reduce the lords' authority in the countryside.
<ul>
<li>If a poor cultivator could conceal himself in a town from his lord for a year, he was free forever.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the stock accumulated by the industrious of the countryside naturally took refuge in cities.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="the-development-of-foreign-commerce">The Development of Foreign Commerce</h3>
<p>13 City-people ultimately derive their subsistence and raw materials from the countryside.</p>
<p>The subsistence and materials of a coastal city or one near a navigable river can be sourced from anywhere in the world in exchange for its manufactured produce.</p>
<ul>
<li>City-people can be the carriers between distant countries and exchange their produce.</li>
<li>In this way, a city, no matter how poor, can become wealthy</li>
</ul>
<!--   and splendour, including:
    its surrounding areas, and
    all the countries where it trades to. -->
<ul>
<li>Its trading partners individually might be able to afford only a small part of its products. But all of them taken together could afford much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the narrow circle of commerce of the past, some countries became opulent and industrious. Examples were:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Greek empire,</li>
<li>the Arabs during the Abassid Caliphate,</li>
<li>Egypt before it was conquered by the Turks,</li>
<li>some parts of the North African coast, and</li>
<li>Spain under the Moors.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 id="the-public-spending-for-the-crusades-boosted-the-private-profits-of-the-italian-cities">The Public Spending for the Crusades Boosted the Private Profits of the Italian Cities</h3>
<p>14 The Italian cities were the first in Europe raised by commerce to opulence. Back then, Italy was in the centre of the civilized world.</p>
<p>The Crusades too, were extremely favourable to some Italian cities, even if they retarded the progress of the rest of Europe by their death and great waste of stock.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their armies gave extraordinary encouragement to the shipping of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa.</li>
<li>Italian shipping transported and supplied them.
<ul>
<li>They were the commissaries of those armies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the most destructive frenzy in Europe was a source of opulence to those republics.</p>
<p>15 The people of trading cities afforded some food to the vanity of the great proprietors by importing the improved manufactures and luxuries of richer countries.</p>
<p>The proprietors eagerly bought them with much of their rude produce.</p>
<p>European commerce back then consisted chiefly in the exchange of their own rude produce for the manufactures of more civilized nations.</p>
<ul>
<li>English wool was exchanged for French wines and the fine cloths of Belgium.</li>
<li>Polish wheat is currently exchanged for French wines and brandies and the silks and velvets of France and Italy.</li>
</ul>
