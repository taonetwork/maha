          <h3 id="the-origin-of-the-propensity-to-save">The Origin of the Propensity to Save</h3>
<p>28 Regarding profusion, the passion for present enjoyment is the principle which prompts to spend.</p>
<p>It is sometimes violent and very difficult to restrain.
Generally, it is only momentary and occasional.
The desire of bettering our condition is the principle which prompts to save.
It is a desire which is generally calm and dispassionate.
It comes with us from birth and never leaves us until we die.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to improve their lives.</p>
<p>Most propose to do this through the increase of fortune.
It is the most vulgar and obvious means.
The most likely way of increasing their fortune is to save and accumulate a part of what they acquire.</p>
<p>The principle of spending prevails in almost all men sometimes.</p>
<p>It prevails in some men almost all the time.
Yet in the lifetime of most men, frugality predominates very greatly.</p>
<p>29 Regarding misconduct, there are everywhere much more prudent and successful undertakings than injudicious and unsuccessful ones.</p>
<p>Despite many complaints of the frequency of bankruptcies, only a few businessmen, perhaps not more 0.1%, go bankrupt.
Bankruptcy is perhaps the greatest and most humiliating calamity for an innocent man.
Most men are careful to avoid it.
Some do not avoid it, as some do not avoid the gallows.</p>
<p>30 Great nations are never impoverished by private prodigality and misconduct.</p>
<p>But they sometimes are impoverished by public prodigality and misconduct.
In most countries, the whole public revenue is employed in maintaining unproductive hands composed of:
splendid courts,
great ecclesiastical establishments,
great fleets and armies who produce nothing in peacetime and cannot repay their expenses in wartime.
Such people are all maintained by the produce of other men&rsquo;s labour.
When multiplied unnecessarily, they may consume so much produce that they leave nothing for maintaining the productive labourers, who should reproduce it next year.
The next year&rsquo;s produce will be less, and the third year&rsquo;s will be much less.
Those unproductive hands might consume so great a share of the whole revenue of society, that they encroach on its capital.
Those unproductive hands might consume the funds maintaining productive labour.
All the frugality and good conduct of individuals might not be able to compensate the waste created by this forced encroachment.</p>
<p>32 This frugality and good conduct is enough to compensate private prodigality and misconduct and government extravagance.</p>
<p>Public, national, and private opulence is originally derived from the principle of the uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition.
This principle is frequently powerful enough to maintain the natural progress of things towards improvement despite:
the extravagance of government, and
the greatest errors of administration.
This is similar to the unknown principle of animal life which frequently restores health and vigour in spite of:
the disease, and
the doctor’s absurd prescriptions.</p>
<p>32 The annual produce of the land and labour of any nation can be increased in value only by increasing the number of productive workers or their productive powers.</p>
<p>The number of its productive workers cannot be increased without an increase of capital in the form of:
some addition and improvement to those machines which facilitate labour, and
a more proper division and distribution of employment.
In either case, an additional capital is almost always needed.
Much more capital is needed to keep each worker constantly employed when labour is greatly divided, than where labour is undivided.
When a country&rsquo;s produce is greater in the current than the previous year, we may be assured:
that its capital must have increased, and
that the good conduct of some people have added more to the national capital than was taken from it by:
private misconduct, or
government extravagance.
But this is the case of almost all nations in peacetime, even without prudent governments.
To form a proper judgement of it, we must compare the country at distant periods.
Improvement is not sensible at near periods because progress is frequently very gradual.
People frequently suspect that the country’s riches and industry are decaying from the decline of certain industries even in prosperous times.</p>
<p>38 England&rsquo;s national annual produce is certainly greater now than a century ago at the restoration of Charles 2​nd.</p>
<p>However, every five years some authoritative book or pamphlet is published pretending to demonstrate that:
the national wealth is fast declining,
the country is being depopulated,
agriculture is being neglected,
manufactures are decaying, and
trade is becoming undone.
Not all of these publications were party pamphlets.
Party pamphlets are the wretched offspring of falsehood and greed.
Many of them were written by very intelligent people who wrote what they believed in.</p>
<p>34 England&rsquo;s national annual produce was much greater at the Restoration than at the accession of Elizabeth 100 years before.</p>
<p>England was much more advanced during the accession of Elizabeth than during the end of the dissensions between the houses of York and Lancaster a century before.
It was probably in a better condition during those dissensions than during the Norman Conquest.
It was better during the Norman Conquest than during the confusion of the Saxon Heptarchy.
It was more improved at the Saxon Heptarchy than at the invasion of Julius Cæsar, when its inhabitants were in the same state with the savages in North America.</p>
<p>35 In each of those periods, there was much private and public profusion.</p>
<p>There were many expensive and unnecessary wars.
Such absolute waste and destruction of stock during those times:
retarded the natural accumulation of riches, and
rendered the country poorer than at the beginning.
Many disorders and misfortunes happened from the time of the Restoration that could have impoverished and ruined England:
the fire and the plague of London in 1666,
the two Dutch wars,
the disorders of the Revolution,
the war in Ireland,
the four expensive French wars of 1688, 1702, 1742, and 1756, and
two rebellions of 1715 and 1745
During the four French wars, England contracted a debt of more than £145m on top of all the other extraordinary expences.
The total cannot be less than £200m.
Since the Revolution, so great a share of the national produce has been employed to maintain so many unproductive hands.
Without those wars, most of the national produce would have been naturally employed in maintaining productive hands.
The value of the country’s annual produce would have considerably increased every year, increasing the produce of the following year.
More houses would have been built.
More lands would have been improved.
Improved lands would have been better cultivated.
More manufactures would have been established.
Established manufactures would have been more extended.
The country could have reached unimaginable heights of wealth.</p>
<p>36 The wastefulness of government retarded, but was unable to stop, England&rsquo;s natural progress towards wealth.</p>
<p>Its national produce is currently much greater than it was at the Restoration or at the Revolution.
Its annual capital must be much greater.
Despite all the exactions of government, this capital was silently and gradually accumulated by the private frugality and good conduct of individuals from their universal, continual, and uninterrupted effort to better their own condition.
This effort was:
protected by law, and
allowed by liberty to exert itself in the most advantageous way.
This effort maintained English progress towards opulence and improvement in the past.
Hopefully, it will do so in the future.
England was never blessed with a very parsimonious government, and so parsimony never became the characteristic virtue of the English.
Kings and ministers are extremely insolent.
They restrained the expence of private people by:
sumptuary laws, or
banning the importation of foreign luxuries.
Kings and ministers are always the greatest prodigals in society.
Let them look well after their own expence.
Let them safely trust private people with their own expence.
If their own extravagance does not ruin the state, the extravagance of their subjects never will.</p>
