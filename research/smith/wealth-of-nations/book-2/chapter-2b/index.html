          <p>15 Only the ambiguity of language makes this proposition doubtful or paradoxical. It is obvious when properly understood.</p>
<p>16 When we talk of a sum of money, we sometimes only mean the metal pieces it is made of. Sometimes we include in our meaning some obscure reference to the purchasing power it conveys.</p>
<p>This power is the goods which can be bought with it.</p>
<p>When we say that England&rsquo;s circulating money is £18 million, we only mean the amount of metal pieces which circulate in England. But when we say that a man is worth £50-100 a year, we mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount of the metal pieces annually paid to him, and</li>
<li>the value of the goods he can annually buy.</li>
</ul>
<p>We mean to estimate his way of living. His way of living is the quantity and quality of the necessaries and conveniences that he can have.</p>
<p>17 We combine the two meanings ambiguously into the word &lsquo;money&rsquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>the quantity of physical money, and</li>
<li>the purchasing power of that money.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the wealth or revenue is equal only to the purchasing power of money. It is equal to the money&rsquo;s worth, not the money*.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[Translator&rsquo;s Note: The amount is money is objective, the money&rsquo;s worth is subjective]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>18 Thus, if a person’s weekly pension is 1 guinea, he can buy goods and services worth 1 guinea with his pension.</p>
<ul>
<li>His real weekly revenue is determined by the things that he can buy with 1 guinea.</li>
<li>His weekly revenue is certainly not equal both to the guinea and to what can be bought with the guinea.</li>
<li>His weekly revenue is equal to the guinea&rsquo;s worth, not to the actual guinea.</li>
</ul>
<p>19 If his pension were paid in a paper bill representing 1 guinea, his revenue would depend on what he could get for that paper and not the paper itself. The bill will then be considered by all businesses as worth 1 guinea of necessaries and conveniences.</p>
<p>The person&rsquo;s revenue would not consist in paper guinea or gold guinea, but in what he can get for it. If it could be exchanged for nothing, the paper bill would be like a bill upon a bankrupt and be worthless.</p>
<p>20 The revenue of all a country&rsquo;s inhabitants is paid in money.</p>
<p>But their real riches is always proportional to the amount of consumable goods which they can buy with this money. Their entire revenue taken together is not equal to both the money and the consumable goods.</p>
<p>It is only equal to the consumable goods.</p>
<p>21 We frequently express a person&rsquo;s revenue by the money paid to him because the amount of those pieces regulates the value of the goods that he can buy. But we still consider his revenue as consisting in this power of purchasing or consuming, and not in the pieces which convey it.</p>
<p>22 An individual&rsquo;s purchasing power is similar to the society&rsquo;s purchasing power.</p>
<p>The amount of money paid to an individual, is often precisely equal to his revenue. It is thus the shortest and best expression of its value.</p>
<p>But the amount of money circulating in a society can never be equal to the revenue of all its members. The amount of the money circulating in any country must always be of much less value than the worth of that money.</p>
<p>For example, a single 1 guinea coin may pay the pension of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Person A today, which he gives back in exchange for goods,</li>
<li>Person B next week receiving the very same coin, and</li>
<li>Person C next month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their combined purchasing power or combined revenue is 3 guineas, whereas the actual money circulating was only 1 guinea. Their combined revenue therefore cannot consist in the amount of money circulating, which is of much smaller value than their revenue or purchasing power.</p>
<p>23 Physical money is the great wheel of circulation and the great instrument of commerce.</p>
<p>Like all instruments of trade, it makes no part of the revenue of its society.
Physical money makes no part of the revenue, even though it distributes to every man the revenue which belongs to him.</p>
<p>24 Every reduction in the cost of collecting and supporting the circulating capital called money is an improvement exactly of the same kind as every saving and cost-reduction in the building and supporting of fixed capital like machines and tools, as long as the savings do not reduce productivity.</p>
<p>Both savings are an improvement of the society&rsquo;s net revenue.</p>
<p>25 Reducing the cost of supporting the fixed capital improves the society&rsquo;s net revenue.</p>
<p>The owner’s capital is divided between his fixed and circulating capital.
The smaller the one part, the greater must be the other.</p>
<p>The circulating capital furnishes the materials and wages of labour and puts industry into motion.</p>
<p>Every reduction in the cost of maintaining the fixed capital, which does not reduce productivity, must increase the fund which mobilizes industry. The reduction in the cost increases the society&rsquo;s real revenue.</p>
<p>26 The substitution of gold and silver money with paper, replaces a very expensive instrument of commerce with one much less costly. It is sometimes equally convenient.</p>
<p>Circulation is carried on by a new wheel. This new wheel costs less to build and maintain. But it is not obvious how this new wheel increases the gross or net revenue of society.</p>
<p>27 There are many kinds of paper money.</p>
<p>The circulating notes of banks are the best known and best adapted as paper money.</p>
<p>28 When people have such confidence in a banker, they believe that he is always ready to pay upon the presentation of his promissory notes.</p>
<p>Those notes become equal to gold and silver money from the confidence that money can be received for the notes at any time.
promissory</p>
<p>29 A banker lends his own promissory notes worth £100,000 to his debtors.</p>
<p>Since these notes are as good as money, his debtors pay him interest. This interest is his gain.</p>
<p>Some of those notes continually come back to him from the debtor&rsquo;s customers for redemption But some of them continue to circulate for months and years.</p>
<p>Though he has £100,000 of notes in circulation, £20,000 in gold and silver may be enough for answering occasional demands.
£20,000 in gold and silver perform all the functions which £100,000 of gold and silver could have performed.</p>
<p>The same exchanges may be made. The same amount of goods worth £100,000 may be circulated through his promissory notes, as when it was circulated by solely by gold and silver money.</p>
<p>£80,000 of gold and silver can be spared from the country&rsquo;s circulation.</p>
<p>If these operations were done by many banks, the whole circulation may be conducted with 20% of the gold and silver previously needed.
30 Let us suppose that a country&rsquo;s whole circulating money was £1 million.</p>
<p>£1m was enough to circulate the whole national annual produce.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different banks then issued promissory notes for £1m.</li>
<li>They reserved £200,000 in gold and silver for answering occasional demands.</li>
</ul>
<p>There would remain in circulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>£800,000 in gold and silver, and</li>
<li>£1m bank notes, or</li>
<li>£1.8m of combined paper and metal money.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the annual produce the country only required £1m to circulate it to its proper consumers. That annual produce cannot be immediately increased by those operations of banking. £1m will be enough to circulate it.</p>
<p>Since the goods bought and sold are precisely the same, the same amount of money will be enough for buying and selling them. The channel of circulation will remain precisely the same as before.</p>
<p>£1m was enough to fill that channel. Whatever is poured in beyond this sum must overflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>£1.8m are poured into it.38</li>
<li>£800,000 must overflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the excess of what can be employed in the country&rsquo;s circulation. This sum cannot be employed at home, but it is too valuable to be left idle. Therefore, it will be sent abroad to seek profitable employment which it cannot find at home.</p>
<p>But the paper cannot go abroad because:</p>
<ul>
<li>the issuing banks are too far away, and</li>
<li>it is not legal tender in foreign countries</li>
<li>£800,000 in gold and silver will be sent abroad.</li>
</ul>
<p>The channel of home circulation will remain filled with 1 million of paper instead of the 1 million of metals which filled it before.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ Translator&rsquo;s Note: Bretton Woods made the US paper currency acceptable in foreign countries, creating instability in the entire financial system ]</li>
</ul>
<p>31 The gold and silver sent abroad will be exchanged for foreign goods for the home country or another foreign country.</p>
<p>32 If they use it to buy goods from one foreign country to sell to another, it is called the carrying trade.</p>
<p>The profit from this will add to their own country&rsquo;s net revenue. It is like a new fund for a new trade.</p>
<p>Since paper already circulates all domestic business, the gold and silver can be converted to a fund to circulate this new trade.</p>
<p>33 If they employ it in buying foreign goods for home consumption, they may either:</p>
<ol>
<li>buy goods such as foreign wines, silks, etc., likely to be consumed by idle people who produce nothing, or</li>
<li>buy more materials, tools, and provisions to maintain and employ a more industrious people, who reproduce the value of their consumption, with a profit.</li>
</ol>
<p>34 The first method:</p>
<ul>
<li>promotes prodigality,</li>
<li>increases expence and consumption without increasing production,</li>
<li>does not establish any permanent fund for supporting that expence, and</li>
<li>is hurtful to the society in every respect.</li>
</ul>
<p>35 The second method:</p>
<ul>
<li>promotes industry,</li>
<li>increases the society&rsquo;s consumption,</li>
<li>provides a permanent fund for supporting that consumption because the people who consume can reproduce the value that they consumed, with a profit,</li>
<li>increases the society&rsquo;s gross revenue by increasing the whole value added by the labour to those materials,</li>
<li>increases their net revenue by deducting the cost of supporting the tools and instruments of their trade.</li>
</ul>
<p>36 Most of the precious metals forced abroad by banking and used to buy foreign goods for home consumption is used to buy this second kind of goods.</p>
<p>Some people might increase their cost very much without increasing their revenue.</p>
<p>However, no entire class ever does so because most people are prudent.
But the revenue of idle people cannot be increased by banking.
Only the expense of a few among them may be increased by banking.
A very small part of the money forced abroad will be used to buy foreign goods to be consumed by idle people because the demand of the idle will not change much.
Most of the money will be used in industry and not in maintaining idleness.</p>
