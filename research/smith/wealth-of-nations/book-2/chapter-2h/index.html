          <p><sup>79</sup> The Bank of England is the biggest bank of circulation in Europe.</p>
<p>It was incorporated by a charter under the Great Seal on July 27, 1694. It then lent to government £1.2 million in exchange for an annuity of £100,000 composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>£96,000 interest or 8% [1.2m * 0.08], and</li>
<li>£4,000 annually for management expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Glorious Revolution established a new government which had a very low credit because it was obliged to borrow at so high an interest.</p>
<p><sup>80</sup> In 1697, the bank was allowed to enlarge its capital stock by an engraftment of £1,001,171.</p>
<p>Its whole capital stock at this time was £2,201,171. [£1.2m + 1m]</p>
<ul>
<li>This engraftment was to support the public credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1696, tallies had been at 40, 50, and 60% discount.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank notes were at 20% discount.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the great silver recoinage at that time, the Bank discontinued the payment of its notes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bank was necessarily discredited.</li>
</ul>
<p><sup>81</sup> In pursuance of the 7th of Anne, Chapter 7 in 1708, the Bank lent the exchequer £400,000.</p>
<p>This made the sum of £1.6 million. [£1.2m + £400k]</p>
<p>In 1708, therefore, the credit of government was as good as that of private persons, both at 6%.</p>
<ul>
<li>6% was the common legal and market interest rate of those times.</li>
</ul>
<p>In pursuance of the same act, the bank cancelled exchequer bills at £1,775,027 at 6% interest.</p>
<p>At the same time, it allowed to take in subscriptions to double its capital.</p>
<p>In 1708, the bank&rsquo;s capital was therefore £4,402,343. [£2.2m * 2]
It had advanced to government £3,375,027. [£1.6m +£1.77m]</p>
<p><sup>82</sup> By a call of 15% in 1709, £656,204 was paid in.</p>
<p>In 1710, another 10% £501,448 was paid in.
In consequence of those two calls, therefore, the bank capital amounted to £5,559,995. [£4.4m + £656k + £501k]</p>
<p><sup>83</sup> In pursuance of the 3 rd of George 1st, Chapter 8 in 1716, the bank delivered £2m of exchequer bills to be cancelled.</p>
<p>It had, therefore, advanced to government £5,375,027. [£3.37m + £2m]
In pursuance of the 8th of George 1st, Chapter 21 in 1721, the bank bought £4m of South Sea Company stock.</p>
<p>In 1722, its capital stock was increased by £3.4m because of the purchase.
At this time, therefore:
the bank had lent £9,375,027 to the government, [£5.37m + £4m]
but the bank&rsquo;s capital stock was only £8,959,995. [£5.5m + 3.4 m]
The sum lent to the government, and for which it received interest, began to exceed its capital stock.
Its capital stock is the source of the dividends paid to the owners of the bank stock.
In other words, the Bank began to have an undivided capital, in excess of its divided capital stock.
It has continued to have the same kind of undivided capital ever since.
In 1746, the Bank had lent £11,686,800 to the government.
Its divided capital has been raised to £10,780,000 by different calls and subscriptions.
The state of those two sums has continued to be the same ever since.
In pursuance of the 4th of George 3rd, Chapter 25 in 1763, the Bank paid £110,000 to the government for the renewal of its charter.
This sum, therefore, did not increase those two other sums.</p>
<p><sup>84</sup> The Bank dividend has varied according to the variations in the interest rate that it received and other circumstances.</p>
<p>This interest rate has gradually been reduced from 8% to 3%.75
For some years past, the bank dividend has been at 5.5%.</p>
<p><sup>85</sup> The stability of the Bank of England is equal to the stability of the British government.</p>
<p>All that it has lent to the government must be lost before its creditors can sustain any loss.
No other banking company in England can:
be established by an act of Parliament, or
consist of more than six members.</p>
<p>It acts as an:</p>
<ul>
<li>a great engine of state, and</li>
</ul>
<p>It receives and pays most of the annuities due to the creditors of the government.
It circulates exchequer bills.
It advances to government the land and malt taxes which are not paid up until some years after.
In these operations, its duty to the public may sometimes have obliged it, without any fault of its directors, to oversupply paper money.
an ordinary bank:
It discounts merchants' bills.
It has supported the credit of the principal houses of England, Hamburgh, and Holland.</p>
<p>In 1763, it is said to have lent around £1.6m in one week, mostly in bullion.
I do not warrant this sum nor the timespan.
It also has been reduced to paying in sixpences.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="the-role-of-banks-in-increasing-national-wealth">The Role Of Banks In Increasing National Wealth</h2>
<p><sup>86</sup> The judicious operations of banking can increase a country’s industry, not by augmenting the country’s capital, but by rendering most of that capital productive.</p>
<p>The money which a dealer keeps unemployed for answering occasional demands is dead stock.
It produces nothing to him or to his country.
The judicious operations of banking enable him to convert this dead stock into:</p>
<ul>
<li>active and productive stock,</li>
<li>materials to work on,</li>
<li>tools to work with,</li>
<li>provisions to work for, and</li>
<li>stock which produces something to himself and his country.</li>
</ul>
<p>The gold and silver money which circulates a country’s annual produce to its consumers is all dead stock, just like the dealer&rsquo;s ready money.
It is a very valuable part of the country&rsquo;s capital.
Yet it produces nothing to the country.
The judicious operations of banking substitutes much of gold and silver with paper.
It enables the country to convert much of this dead stock into productive stock which produces something.
The gold and silver money which circulates in any country may be compared to a highway.</p>
<p>It carries to market all the country&rsquo;s grass and grain, yet it produces no grass and grain by itself.
The judicious operations of banking provides a sort of wagon-way through the air.
It enables the country to convert much of its highways into good pastures and grain fields.
It increases the annual produce of its land and labour considerably.
However, the country&rsquo;s commerce and industry cannot be so secure when they are suspended on the Dædalian wings of paper money as when they travel on the solid ground of gold and silver.
Commerce and industry may be augmented by paper money.
But the unskillfulness of the conductors of paper money exposes the country to several accidents.</p>
<p>87 If a country&rsquo;s whole circulation were done with paper instead of gold and silver, there would be so much more confusion if its enemy gains:</p>
<ul>
<li>its capital, and</li>
<li>the treasure which supported the credit of the paper money.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exchanges could only then be made by barter or credit.
The prince would not be able to pay his troops or furnish his magazines since all the taxes were paid in paper money.
The country’s state would be much more irretrievable than if most of its circulation consisted in gold and silver.
A prince should guard against the excessive multiplication of paper money which:</p>
<ul>
<li>ruins the banks that issue it, and</li>
<li>enables banks to fill most of the country&rsquo;s circulation.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 id="two-branches-of-circulation-wholesale-and-retail">Two Branches of Circulation: Wholesale and Retail</h2>
<p><sup>88</sup> The circulation of every country is divided into two branches:</p>
<ol>
<li>The circulation of the dealers with one another, and</li>
<li>The circulation between the dealers and the consumers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each circulation requires a certain stock of money.</p>
<p>Paper or metal money may be employed in either circulation.</p>
<p>The value of the goods circulated between the dealers and dealers can never exceed the value of those circulated between dealers and consumers.
Whatever is bought by the dealers is ultimately destined to be sold to consumers.
The circulation between the dealers is carried on by wholesale.
It requires a large sum for every transaction.
The circulation between dealers and consumers, on the contrary, is carried on by retail.
It frequently requires very small sums.
A shilling or a halfpenny is often sufficient.
But small sums circulate much faster than large ones.
A shilling changes masters more frequently than a guinea.
A halfpenny changes masters more frequently than a shilling.
The annual purchases of all the consumers are at least equal in value to the purchases of all the dealers.
However, consumer purchases can be transacted with fewer money pieces which circulate faster through more frequent retail purchases, than wholesale purchases.</p>
<p><sup>89</sup> Paper money may be regulated to confine itself to the circulation between dealers and dealers.</p>
<p>They may be regulated to extend between dealers and consumers.
Where the smallest circulating bank notes are £10, as in London, paper money confines itself very much to the circulation between the dealers.
When a consumer receives a £10 bank note worth 200 shillings, he changes it at the first shop where he will buy 5 shillings' worth of goods.
The £10 note often returns into the dealer&rsquo;s hands before the consumer has spent 1/40th of the money. [5 shillings/200 shillings]</p>
<p>Where bank notes are issued for so small sums as 20 shillings, paper money extends more to the circulation between dealers and consumers.
This happened in Scotland.
10 and 5 shilling notes filled most of that circulation before the Act of Parliament stopped their circulation.
In North American currencies, paper was issued for small sums as a shilling.
Paper shillings filled almost all of that circulation.
In some paper currencies of Yorkshire, it was issued even for a sixpence.</p>
<p><sup>90</sup> Where small bank notes are commonly issued, many mean people are enabled and encouraged to become bankers.</p>
<p>A promissory note for a sixpence will be better received by everybody without scruple than a £5 or 20 shilling note.
But the frequent bankruptcies of such beggarly bankers would be a very big inconvenience.
It would even be a very great calamity to many poor people who received those notes in payment.
91 Perhaps it were better that no bank notes were issued smaller than £5.</p>
<p>Paper money would probably then confine itself to the circulation between the different dealers, as what is happening in London.
In London, no bank notes under £10 are issued.
In most parts of the United Kingdom, £5 will seldom be spent all at once, just as £10 will seldom be spent all at once in London.</p>
<p><sup>92</sup> Gold and silver remains if paper money is confined to the circulation between dealers and dealers, as in London.</p>
<p>But if paper money is extended to the circulation between dealers and consumers:
gold and silver are banished almost entirely, and
almost all the ordinary transactions of its interior commerce are done with paper.
This happened in Scotland and more in North America.
The suppression of 10 and 5 shilling bank notes somewhat relieved the scarcity of gold and silver in Scotland.
The suppression of 20 shilling notes would probably relieve it more.
Those metals became more abundant in America since the suppression of some of their paper currencies.
Gold and silver were more abundant before the institution of those currencies.</p>
<p><sup>93</sup> Banks can still give the same assistance to its country&rsquo;s industry and commerce if paper money were confined to the circulation between dealers and dealers, as when paper money filled almost the whole circulation.</p>
<p>The dealer&rsquo;s ready money for answering occasional demands is destined to circulate between himself and the other dealers he buys goods from.
He does not need to keep ready money to circulate between himself and the consumers because the consumers bring ready money to him.
Banks can still relieve those dealers from needing to keep ready money unemployed for answering occasional demands by:
discounting real bills of exchange, and
lending on cash accounts even if the circulation would be confined between dealers and dealers.</p>
<p><sup>94</sup> It may be said that the following are violations of natural liberty which the law should support and not infringe:</p>
<ul>
<li>restraining private people from receiving a banker&rsquo;s promissory notes which they are willing to receive, and</li>
<li>restraining a banker from issuing such notes which everyone is willing to accept.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals which might endanger the security of the whole society, should be restrained by the laws of all governments, of the most free as well as of the most despotical.</p>
<p>The obligation of building firewalls is a violation of natural liberty of the same kind with the banking regulations here proposed.</p>
