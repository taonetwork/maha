          <h3 id="chapter-57-the-state-should-have-concise-but-efficient-laws">Chapter 57: The State Should Have Concise but Efficient Laws</h3>
<p>1 A state may be ruled by measures of correction. Weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity. But the kingdom is made one&rsquo;s own only by freedom from action and purpose.</p>
<br>
<p>2 The multiplication of prohibitive laws increases the poverty of the people.</p>
<p>The more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan;</p>
<p>The more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear;</p>
<p>The more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are.</p>
<br>
<p>3 Therefore a sage has said:</p>
<div class="squote" data-sal="slide-right">
'I will do nothing of purpose. This will let the people be transformed by themselves. I will keep still and the people will correct themselves. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich. I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.'
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="chapter-58-liberty">Chapter 58: Liberty</h3>
<p>1 The government that seems the most unwise often supplies the most goodness to the people.</p>
<p>The government which meddles and touches everything will <!-- work --> bring disappointment.</p>
<p>Happiness is found by the side of Misery.</p>
<p>Misery lurks beneath Happiness!</p>
<p>Who knows what either will come to in the end?</p>
<br>
<p>2 Shall we then dispense with correction?</p>
<p>The method of correction shall by a turn become distortion. The good in it shall by a turn become evil.
The delusion of the people on this point has indeed subsisted for a long time.</p>
<br>
<p>3 Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness).</p>
<p>He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but does not dazzle.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="chapter-59-moderation">Chapter 59: Moderation</h3>
<p>1 Moderation is the best way to regulate the human<!--  (in our constitution) --> and rendering the<!--  (proper) --> service to the heavenly<!-- , there is nothing like  -->.</p>
<br>
<p>2 It is only by this moderation that there becomes an early return to normalcy. That early return is what I call &lsquo;the repeated accumulation of the attributes of the Tao&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The repeated accumulation of those attributes leads to the subjugation of every obstacle each time. <!--  to such return. 
Of  -->
We do not know what shall be the limit of this subjugation. When one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state.</p>
<br>
<p>3 He who possesses the mother of the state may rule a long time. He is like a plant with deep roots and firm flower stalks. These secure the plant for it to have a long life.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="chapter-60-managing-the-state">Chapter 60: Managing the State</h3>
<p>1 Governing a great state is like cooking small fish.</p>
<br>
<p>2 The state should be governed according to the Tao or True Nature. In this way, the cooking up of criticism will not produce a bad smell.</p>
<!-- the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. --> 
<p>It is not that the cooking does not produce smells, but that the smells will not hurt men.</p>
<!-- manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men.  -->
<!-- It is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men.  -->
<p>It is not that the smells could <!-- not --> hurt men, but because the ruling sage will not use it to hurt them.</p>
<br>
<p>3 When the ruler and his subjects do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue of the Tao or True Nature.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="chapter-61-federalism">Chapter 61: Federalism</h3>
<p>1 What makes a state great is its being like a low-lying, down-flowing stream. It becomes the centre to which tend all the small states under heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>2 This is shown by females. The female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered a sort of abasement.</p>
<br>
<p>3 Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself. Here, the abasement leads to gaining adherents.</p>
<p>Small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. Here, the abasement leads to procuring favour.</p>
<br>
<p>4 The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them. A small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself.</p>
