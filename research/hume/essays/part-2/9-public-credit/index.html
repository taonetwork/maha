          <p>In ancient times, the common practice was to hoard up treasures during peacetime for paying conquest or defence during wartime. They did not resort to taxation or borrowing in times of disorder and confusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Athenians, Ptolemies, and the other successors of Alexander amassed immense large sums.</li>
<li>Plato says that the frugal Spartans had also collected a great treasure.</li>
<li>Arrian and Plutarch took notice of Alexander&rsquo;s riches from the conquest of Susa and Ecbatana, which came from the time of Cyrus.</li>
<li>The Bible also mentions the treasure of Hezekiah and the Jewish princes.</li>
<li>Profane history mentions that of Philip and Perseus, kings of Macedon.</li>
<li>The ancient republics of Gaul had commonly large sums in reserve.</li>
<li>Julius Cæsar seized treasure in Rome during the civil wars.</li>
<li>The wiser emperors, Augustus, Tiberius, Vespasian, Severus, etc. always saved great sums against any public exigency.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the contrary, our modern way is to mortgage the public revenues and to trust that posterity will pay off the debts contracted by their ancestors. That posterity then also rely on their own posterity out of necessity instead of choice.</p>
<p>The ancient maxims are more prudent than our modern ruinous practice. It has been possible to practice peacetime frugality as to discharge the debts from an expensive war.</p>
<!-- Why should the case be so  between the  -->
<p>A society&rsquo;s public debt is not so different from that of an individual. <!-- , as to make us establish different maxims of conduct for each?  --></p>
<ul>
<li>If the public funds are greater, its expences are also greater.</li>
</ul>
<!-- - If its resources are more numerous, they are not infinite. -->
<ul>
<li>The lifetime of a society is much longer than a person&rsquo;s lifetime<!-- , or even of a family, --> &ndash; it should embrace maxims, large, durable, and generous, agreeably to the supposed extent of its existence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The necessity of human affairs makes resort to chances and temporary expedients. But whoever voluntarily depends on debt does it not out of necessity, but out of their own folly.</p>
<p>The abuses of treasures are dangerous by:</p>
<ul>
<li>engaging the state in rash enterprizes, or</li>
<li>making it neglect military discipline, in confidence of its riches.</li>
</ul>
<p>The abuses of borrowing inevitably leads to poverty, impotence, and subjection to foreign powers.</p>
<!-- to modern policy war is attended with every destructive circumstance; loss of men, encrease of taxes, decay of commerce, dissipation of money, devastation by sea and land.  -->
<p>According to ancient maxims, the public spending and incurring debt temporarily encouraged industry and made up for the calamities of war. Ministers tend to do it as it gives them glory without burdening the people with taxes.</p>
<p>This practice of contracting debt is almost abused in every government. It is imprudent to give a prodigal son a credit in every banker’s shop in London, just as it is to empower a statesman to contract debt to be paid by future generations.</p>
<p>The paradox is that debt gives us riches, but it also ruins us.</p>
<!-- then shall we say to the new paradox, that public incumbrances, are, of themselves, advantageous, independent of the necessity of contracting them; and that any state, even though it were not pressed by a foreign enemy, could not possibly have embraced a wiser expedient for promoting commerce and riches, than to create funds, and debts, and taxes, without limitation?  -->
<!-- These reasonings, such as these, might naturally have passed for trials of wit among rhetoricians, like the panegyrics on folly and a fever, on Busiris and Nero, had we not seen such absurd maxims patronized by great ministers,9 and by a whole party among us.cus examine the consequences of public debts, both in our domestic management, by their influence on commerce and industry; and in our foreign transactions, by their effect on wars and negociations.d -->
<br>
<h3 id="why-do-creditors-lend-to-government">Why do creditors lend to government?</h3>
<p>Securities are with us become a kind of money, and pass as readily as gold or silver. Wherever any profitable undertaking offers itself, there are always people available to embrace it no matter how expensive it is. A trader who invests in the public stocks is afraid to enter into the most extensive trade since he must have his funds ready to answer the most sudden demand made upon him.  No merchant thinks it necessary to keep any considerable cash by him as he puts them in stocks.</p>
<p>Bank-stock, or India-bonds, serve the same purposes as public stock. The trader can sell them or pledge them to a banker in 15 minutes. They are not idle even when in his scritoire. These bring him in a constant revenue.</p>
<p>In short, our national debts furnish merchants with a species of money, that is continually multiplying in their hands. It produces sure gain, besides the profits of their commerce. This enables them to trade on less profit. The small profit of the merchant renders the commodity cheaper. This causes a greater consumption and quickens the labour of the common people. It helps to spread arts and industry throughout the whole society.</p>
<p>In England and in all states which have both commerce and public debts, there are men who are half merchants, half stock-holders. They are willing to trade for small profits because commerce is not their principal support. Their revenues in the funds are a sure resource for themselves and their families.</p>
<p>Were there no funds, great merchants can only invest in land which has many disadvantages compared to funds. Land requires more care, time, and inspection of the merchant. It is not easily converted into money. It <!-- ; and as it attracts too much, both by the many natural pleasures it affords, and the authority it gives, it --> soon converts the citizen into the country gentleman.</p>
<p>Men with large stocks and incomes can naturally continue in commerce if there are public debts. This reduces its profits, promotes circulation, and encourages industry. <!-- , in opposition to these two favourable circumstances, perhaps of no very great importance, weigh the many disadvantages which attend our public debts, in the whole interior œconomy of the state: You will find no comparison between the ill and the good which result from them. --></p>
<p>These advantages are offset by the disadvantage of bringing people and riches to the capital, by the great sums, levied in the provinces to pay the interest. It gives an advantage to the merchants in the capital above the rest of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Is it for the public interest, that so many privileges should be conferred on London, which has already arrived at such an enormous size, and seems still encreasing?</p>
<p>I think that the head is too large for the body. But London is so happily situated that its excessive bulk causes less inconvenience than a smaller capital to a larger kingdom.</p>
<p>There is more difference between the prices of provisions in Paris and Languedoc, than between those in London and Yorkshire. The immense greatness of London, under a government which admits not of discretionary power, renders the people factious, mutinous, seditious, and even perhaps rebellious. But the national debts themselves tend to remedy this evil.</p>
<p>The first visible eruption of public disorders alarms all the stockholders for their property. It will make them fly to the support of government, whether menaced by Jacobitish violence or democratical frenzy.</p>
<p>Public stocks are a kind of paper-credit. They have all the disadvantages that money has.</p>
<p>They banish gold and silver from the considerable commerce of the state and reduce them to common circulation. This makes all provisions and labour dearer. The taxes, which are levied to pay the interests of these debts either raise the price of labour or oppress the poor.</p>
<p>Foreigners possess a great share of our national funds. They render the public, in a manner, tributary to them. They can, in time, bring our people and our industry.</p>
<p>Most of the public stock is always in the hands of idle people who live on the revenue of the industrious. Our funds, in that view, greatly encourage a useless and unactive life.</p>
<p>though the injury, that arises to commerce and industry from our public funds, will appear, upon balancing the whole, not inconsiderable,</p>
<p>But it is trivial relative to the prejudice in politics which is essential in nations who have transactions with other states in wars and negotiations.</p>
<p>The ill, there, is pure and unmixed, without any favourable circumstance to atone for it. It is an ill too of a nature the highest and most important.have, indeed, been told, that the public is no weaker upon account of its debts.</p>
<p>Since they are mostly due among ourselves, and bring as much property to one as they take from another.</p>
<p>It is like transferring money from the right hand to the left. This leaves the person neither richer nor poorer than before. Such loose reasonings and specious comparisons will always pass, where we judge not upon principles.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="is-it-possible-to-overburden-a-nation-with-taxes">Is it possible to overburden a nation with taxes?</h3>
<p>The very doubt seems extravagant; since it is requisite, in every community, that there be a certain proportion observed between the laborious and the idle part of it.</p>
<p>But if all our present taxes are mortgaged, must we not invent new ones?</p>
<p>And may not this matter be carried to a length that is ruinous and destructive?</p>
<p>every nation, there are always some methods of levying money more easy than others, agreeably to the way of living of the people, and the commodities they make use of.</p>
<p>In Great Britain, the excises on malt and beer afford a large revenue because the operations of malting and brewing are tedious and impossible to be concealed. At the same time, these commodities are not so absolutely necessary to life. Raising their price would very much affect the poor.</p>
<!-- These taxes being all mortgaged, what difficulty to find new ones! 

What vexation and ruin of the poor!upon consumptions are more equal and easy than those upon possessions.  -->
<p>After the excises are exhausted, we must levy taxes!</p>
<p>It is clear that national debt must be limited and that taxes should not be so high.</p>
<!-- all the proprietors of land only stewards to the public, must not necessity force them to practise all the arts of oppression used by stewards; where the 
absence or negligence of the proprietor render them secure against enquiry?


will scarcely be asserted, that no bounds ought ever to be set to s; and that the public would be no weaker, were twelve or fifteen shillings in the pound, land-tax, mortgaged, with all the present customs and excises. 
 -->
<p>There is something, therefore, in the case, beside the mere transferring of property from the one hand to another.</p>
<!-- In 500 years, the posterity of those now in the coaches, and of those upon the boxes, will probably have changed places, without affecting the public by these revolutions.the public once fairly brought to that condition, to which it is hastening with such amazing rapidity;  -->
<p>Suppose that:</p>
<ul>
<li>land is taxed at 18 shillings in the pound. The maximum acceptable tax is 20 shillings before commerce and industry is negatively affected.</li>
<li>those funds are mortgaged to perpetuity</li>
</ul>
<!-- , and
- the invention of all our projectors can find no new imposition, which may serve as the foundation of a new loan.  -->
<!--  for it can never bear the whole 20 suppose all the excises and customs to be screwed up to the utmost which the nation can bear, without entirely losing its  -->. 
<!-- Though the imperfect state of our political knowledge, and the narrow capacities of men, make it difficult to fortel the effects which will result from any untried measure,  -->
<p>The seeds of ruin are here scattered so well to show an unnatural state of society. The tax revenue from land rent and customs and excise will only go to the stockholders. These are men, who have no connexions with the state, can enjoy their revenue anywhere in the world. They will live in the capital or in great cities in stupid and pampered luxury without spirit, ambition, or enjoyment.<!-- have extra revenue are  --></p>
<!--  persons who have revenue beyond the immediate effects of their industry, are the , who draw almost all the rent of the land and houses, besides the produce of all the customs and excises.  -->
<!-- Adieu to all ideas of nobility, gentry, and family.  -->
<p>The stocks can be transferred instantly. It will seldom be transmitted three generations from father to son because these are in such a fluctuating state. If they belonged so long in one family, they convey no hereditary authority to the possessor.</p>
<p>In this way, the nobility is entirely lost, together with their military. Every man in authority will derive his influence from the sovereign himself.</p>
<!-- By this means, the several ranks of men, which form a kind of independent magistracy in a state, instituted by the hand of nature, are -->  
<p>Only mercenary armies will be able to suppress insurrections. Tyranny will no longer be resisted. Elections will be swayed by bribery and corruption alone. The middle power between king and people will be totally removed. A grievous despotism must infallibly prevail.</p>
<p>The landholders are:</p>
<ul>
<li>despised for their poverty, and</li>
<li>hated for their oppressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>They will be unable to oppose any law that imposes taxes which hurts commerce and discourages industry. <!--  it will be impossible for men, in subjects of such extreme delicacy, to reason so justly as never to be mistaken, or amidst difficulties so urgent, never to be seduced from their resolution. -->  The continual fluctuations in commerce require continual changes in the nature of the taxes. This exposes the legislature to the danger both of willful and involuntary error.</p>
<p>The whole system of government will be thrown into confusion by any great blow to trade, whether by injudicious taxes or by other accidents.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-the-public-do-to-support-its-foreign-wars-and-enterprizes-and-defend-its-own-honour-and-interests-or-those-of-its-allies">What can the public do to support its foreign wars and enterprizes and defend its own honour and interests or those of its allies?</h3>
 <!-- employ, even supposing trade to continue in the most flourishing condition, in order -->
<p>I do not ask how the public is to exert such a prodigious power as it has maintained during our late wars; where we have so much exceeded, not only our own natural strength, but even that of the greatest empires.</p>
<p>This extravagance is the abuse complained of, as the source of all the dangers, to which we are at present exposed.</p>
<p>If we still suppose that great commerce and opulence remains even after every fund is mortgaged, how can the public support it?</p>
<p>It can only be done by a poll tax. But this policy will depend on whether the king has absolute master or is controlled by national councils, in which the annuitants bears the principal sway.</p>
<!-- a continual taxation of the annuitants, or, which is the same thing, from mortgaging anew a certain part of their annuities as to contribute to their own defence.  -->
<ul>
<li>If the prince is absolute, he can tax the annuitants. No oriental monarchy has yet attained this kind of despotism.</li>
</ul>
<!-- , which amount only to the retaining money in his own hands, that this species of property would soon lose all its credit, and the whole income of every individual in the state must lie entirely at the mercy of the sovereign:  -->
<!-- A degree of , which  ever yet attained.  -->
<ul>
<li>If, on the contrary, the consent of the annuitants are needed for every taxation, they will never be persuaded to support the government. In some republics, of a 100th penny, and sometimes of the 50th is given to the support of the state. But this is always an extraordinary exertion of power, and can never become the foundation of a constant national defence.</li>
</ul>
<!-- The diminution of their revenue must in that case be very sensible, would not be disguised under the appearance of a branch of excise or customs, and would not be shared by any other order of the state, who are already supposed to be taxed to the utmost.  -->
<!-- We have always found, where a government has mortgaged all its revenues, that it necessarily sinks into .are the inconveniencies, which may reasonably be foreseen, of this situation, to which  -->
<h3 id="british-debt-trap">British debt trap</h3>
<p>Great Britain is visibly tending towards a state of languor, inactivity, and impotence from its debts. We cannot expect that our current or future ministry will be frugal, or that our foreign affairs will be long peaceful, as to reduce our debts<!-- ; or that the situation of foreign affairs will, for any long time, allow them leisure and tranquillity for such an undertaking -->.</p>
<!-- Not to mention, the numberless inconveniencies, which cannot be foreseen, and which must result from so monstrous a situation as that of making the public the chief or sole proprietor of land, besides investing it with every branch of customs and excise, which the fertile imagination of ministers and projectors have been able to invent.must confess, that there is a strange supineness, from long custom, creeped into all ranks of men, with regard to public debts, not unlike what divines so vehemently complain of with regard to their religious doctrines.  -->
<!-- What then is to become of us? Were we ever so good Christians, and ever so resigned to Providence; this, methinks, were a curious question, even considered as a speculative one, and what it might not be altogether impossible to form some conjectural solution of. The events here will depend little upon the contingencies of battles, negociations, intrigues, and factions.  -->
<!-- There seems to be a natural progress of things, which may guide our reasoning. As it would have required but a moderate share of prudence, when we first began this practice of mortgaging, to have foretold, from the nature of men and of ministers, that things would necessarily be carried to the length we see; so now, that they have at last happily reached it, it may not be difficult to guess at the consequences.  -->
<p>Our national debt has two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>the nation must destroy public credit, or</li>
<li>public credit will destroy the nation.</li>
</ul>
<!-- It is impossible that they can both subsist, after the manner they have been hitherto managed, in this, as well as in some other countries.was, indeed, a scheme for the payment of our debts, which was proposed by an excellent citizen,  -->
<p>Mr. Hutchinson over 30 years ago proposed the following to pay off our debts.<!-- , and which was much approved of by some men of sense, but never was likely to take effect.  --></p>
<p>He asserted that it was false to think that the public owed this debt. He says that it must be paid by each person according to his property because levying excise is costly.</p>
<!--  ; for that really every individual owed a proportional share of it, and paid, in his taxes, a proportional share of the interest, beside the expence of levying these taxes. Had we not better, then, says he, make a distribution of the debt among ourselves, and each of us contribute a sum suitable to his property, and by that means discharge at once all our funds and public mortgages?  -->
<p>But he did not consider that the laborious poor pay a considerable part of the taxes by their annual consumptions, even if they individually pay small amounts. Property in money and stock in trade might easily be concealed or disguised.  Visible property in lands and houses would really be the final resort to pay the debt. It would be an inequality and oppression, which never would be submitted to.</p>
<!-- though they could not advance, at once, a proportional part of the sum required.  -->
<p>This might seem improbable, but when the nation becomes heartily sick of their debts, some daring projector might push for this.</p>
<!-- Public credit will begin, by that time, to be a little frail, the least touch will destroy it, as happened in France during the regency and in this manner it will die of the doctor. 

The breach of national faith will likely be the necessary effect of wars, defeats, misfortunes, and public calamities, or even perhaps of victories and conquests. --> 
<p>I am reminded of a match of cudgel-playing fought in a China shop when I see princes and states fighting amidst their debts.</p>
<p>How can it be expected, that sovereigns will spare a species of property, which is pernicious to themselves and to the public, when they have so little compassion on lives and properties, that are useful to both?</p>
<p>The time will come when new public debt can no longer be repaid due to our nation&rsquo;s cash or our faith being exhausted. If we are threatened with an invasion, a rebellion will break out at home. A squadron cannot be equipped for lack of money.</p>
<!-- Let the time come (and surely it will come) when the new funds, created for the exigencies of the year, are not subscribed to, and raise not the money projected. -->
<p>What will a prince or minister do?</p>
<!-- Every person and community has the right of self-preservation. The folly of our statesmen is thus greater than the folly of those who first contracted debt, or, what is more, than that of those who trusted, or continue to trust this security, if these statesmen have the means of safety in their hands, and do not employ them.  -->
<!-- The funds from the debt by that time, will bring in a large yearly revenue, sufficient for the nation's defence.  -->
<!-- Money is perhaps lying in the exchequer, ready for the discharge of the quarterly interest. The money will immediately be seized for the current service. -->
<!-- Necessity calls.
Fear urges.
Reason exhorts.
Compassion alone exclaims. -->
<p>The whole fabric, already tottering, falls to the ground, and buries thousands in its ruins. This is the &lsquo;natural death of public credit&rsquo; similar to a body that decomposes and dissolves.</p>
<p>Most of mankind are great dupes. Such a voluntary bankruptcy in England would create a violent shock to public credit. <!-- , as  occasion, it would not probably be long ere credit would again revive in as flourishing a condition as before. --></p>
<!-- The present king of France, during the late war, borrowed money at lower interest than his grandfather ever did. It was as low as the British parliament, comparing the natural rate of interest in both kingdoms.  -->
<!-- Men are more governed by what they have seen, than by what they foresee with whatever certainty. Yet promises, protestations, fair appearances, with the allurements of present interest, have such powerful influence as few are able to resist. --> 
<!-- Mankind are, in all ages, caught by the same baits. The same tricks, played over and over again, still trepan them.  -->
<!-- The heights of popularity and patriotism are still the beaten road to power and tyranny; flattery to treachery; standing armies to arbitrary government; and the glory of God to the temporal interest of the clergy. The fear of an everlasting destruction of credit, allowing it to be an evil, is a needless bugbear. -->
<p>It would be better for the nation to borrow again instead of declaring bankruptcy. An opulent knave, even though one could not force him to pay, is a preferable debtor to an honest bankrupt who has no power to pay.</p>
<!-- A prudent man would rather lend to the public immediately after we had taken a spunge to our debts, than at present; as much as .

For the former, in order to carry on business, may find it his interest to discharge his debts, where they are not exorbitant: The latter has it not in his power. 

The reasoning of Tacitus is eternally true and is very applicable to our present case.  -->
<!-- Sed vulgus ad magnitudinem beneficiorum aderat: Stultissimus quisque pecuniis mercabatur: Apud sapientes cassa habebantur, quæ neque dari neque accipi, salva republica, poterant.  -->
<p>The public is a debtor, whom no man can oblige to pay. Creditors will still lend because they are creditors.</p>
<!-- The only check which the creditors have upon her, is the interest of preserving credit. It is an interest, which may easily be overbalanced by a great debt, and by a difficult and extraordinary emergence, even supposing that credit irrecoverable.  -->
<p>A present necessity often forces states into measures which are against their interest. The two events above, poll taxes and bankruptcy, are calamitous, but not the most calamitous.</p>
<p>Thousands are thereby sacrificed to the safety of millions. But we are not without danger, that the contrary event may take place, and that millions may be sacrificed for ever to the temporary safety of thousands.</p>
<p>Our popular government will render it difficult for a minister to declare a voluntary bankruptcy. The house of Lords is composed of proprietors of land. They and the house of Commons have no great property in the funds.</p>
<!-- Yet the connections of the members may be so great with the proprietors, as to render them more tenacious of public faith, than prudence, policy, or even justice, strictly speaking, requires.  -->
<h3 id="invasion-from-debt">Invasion from Debt</h3>
<p>Our foreign enemies may be so politic as to discover that our safety is gone. <!-- lies in despair, and may not, therefore, show the danger, open and barefaced, till it be inevitable. --></p>
<p>The balance of power in Europe historically has been maintained by our attention and assistance. But our children, weary of the struggle, might give up and see themselves and their creditors at the mercy of the conqueror.</p>
<p>This is the violent death of our public credit. <!-- seem to be the events, which are not very remote, and which reason foresees as clearly almost as she can do any thing that lies in the womb of time. --></p>
