          <h2 id="monogamy">Monogamy</h2>
<p>How long should monogamous marriages last? Should we allow voluntary divorces, which were customary among the Greeks and Romans?</p>
<h3 id="arguments-for-divorce">Arguments for Divorce</h3>
<ol>
<li>Loveless marriages just increase hate and pain</li>
</ol>
<p>Disgust and aversion often arises after marriage from:</p>
<ul>
<li>the most trivial accidents, or</li>
<li>incompatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Time can add new quarrels and reproaches which makes their mutual wounds fester more every day instead of curing them. Let us separate hearts which were not made to associate together.  Each of them may, perhaps, find another for which it is better fitted.</p>
<p>At least, nothing can be more cruel than to preserve, by violence, an union, which, at first, was made by mutual love, and is now, in effect, dissolved by mutual hatred.</p>
<!-- But the liberty of divorces is not only a cure to hatred and domestic quarrels.  -->
<ol start="2">
<li>Divorces are natural</li>
</ol>
<!--  forces the couple to be together -->
<!-- It is also an admirable preservative against them, and the only secret for keeping alive that love, which first united the married couple.  -->
<p>The heart of man delights in liberty. The very image of constraint is grievous to it.</p>
<p>When you would confine it by violence, to what would otherwise have been its choice, the <!-- inclination immediately changes, and --> desire is turned into aversion.</p>
<p>If polygamy is not allowed, <!--  the public interest will not allow us to enjoy in polygamy that variety, which is so agreeable in love; --> at least, do not deprive us of that liberty<!-- , which is so essentially requisite -->.</p>
<p>I had my choice of who I would marry, my prison. But this is but a small comfort, since it is still a prison.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="arguments-against-divorce">Arguments against divorce</h3>
<ol>
<li>What will happen to the children upon the separation of the parents?</li>
</ol>
<p>Must they be committed to the care of a step-mother; and instead of the fond attention and concern of a parent, feel all the indifference or hatred of a stranger or an enemy?</p>
<p>These inconveniencies are sufficiently felt, where nature has made the divorce by the doom° inevitable to all mortals: And shall we seek to multiply those inconveniencies, by multiplying divorces, and putting it in the power of parents, upon every caprice, to render their posterity miserable?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>If the heart of man naturally delights in liberty, and hates every thing to which it is confined, then that heart naturally submits to necessity, and soon loses an inclination, when there appears an absolute impossibility of gratifying it.</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles are contradictory. But what is man but a heap of contradictions!</p>
<p>Though it is remarkable, that, where principles are, after this manner, contrary in their operation, they do not always destroy each other; but the one or the other may predominate on any particular occasion, according as circumstances are more or less favourable to it. For instance, love is a restless and impatient passion, full of caprices and variations: arising in a moment from a feature, from an air, from nothing, and suddenly extinguishing after the same manner. Such a passion requires liberty above all things; and therefore Eloisa had reason, when, in order to preserve this passion, she refused to marry her beloved Abelard.</p>
<p>How oft, when prest to marriage, have I said,
Curse on all laws but those which love has made:</p>
<p>Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,
Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.</p>
<p>But friendship is a calm and sedate affection, conducted by reason and cemented by habit; springing from long acquaintance and mutual obligations; without jealousies or fears, and without those feverish fits of heat and cold, which cause such an agreeable torment in the amorous passion.</p>
<p>So sober an affection, therefore, as friendship, rather thrives under constraint, and never rises to such a height, as when any strong interest or necessity binds two persons together, and gives them some common object of pursuit.</p>
<p>We need not, therefore, be afraid of drawing the marriage-knot, which chiefly subsists by friendship, the closest possible.</p>
<p>The amity between the persons, where it is solid and sincere, will rather gain by it: And where it is wavering and uncertain, this is the best expedient for fixing it. How many frivolous quarrels and disgusts are there, which people of common prudence endeavour to forget, when they lie under a necessity of passing their lives together; but which would soon be inflamed into the most deadly hatred, were they pursued to the utmost, under the prospect of an easy separation?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Nothing is more dangerous than to unite two persons so closely in all their interests and concerns, as man and wife, without rendering the union entire and total.</li>
</ol>
<p>The least possibility of a separate interest must be the source of endless quarrels and suspicions. The wife, not secure of her establishment, will still be driving some separate end or project;h and the husband’s selfishness, being accompanied with more power, may be still more dangerous.
Should these reasons against voluntary divorces be deemed insufficient, I hope no body will pretend to refuse the testimony of experience.</p>
<p>At the time when divorces were most frequent among the Romans, marriages were most rare; and Augustus was obliged, by penal laws, to force men of fashion into the married state.</p>
<p>A circumstance which is scarcely to be found in any other age or nation.</p>
<p>The more ancient laws of Rome, which prohibited divorces, are extremely praised by Dionysius Halycarnassæus.8 Wonderful was the harmony, says the historian, which this inseparable union of interests produced between married persons; while each of them considered the inevitable necessity by which they were linked together, and abandoned all prospect of any other choice or establishment.</p>
<p>The exclusion of polygamy and divorces sufficiently recommends our present European practice with regard to marriage.</p>
