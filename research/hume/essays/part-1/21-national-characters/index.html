              <h2 style="margin: 0 !important;">Essay 21 by David Hume of Part 1</h2>

          <p>1 Shallow people often carry all national characters to extremes. They categorize everyone and think that any people are knavish, cowardly, or ignorant without exception.</p>
<p>Men of sense condemn these undistinguishing judgments. But at the same time, they say that each nation has:</p>
<ul>
<li>a peculiar set of manners, and</li>
<li>some particular qualities are more frequently seen among one people than others.</li>
</ul>
<p>The common people in Switzerland are probably more honest than those Ireland. From that circumstance alone, every prudent man will make a difference in the trust which he gives to a Swiss and an Irish man.</p>
<p>We expect greater wit and gaiety in a Frenchman than in a Spaniard even if Cervantes was a Spaniard.</p>
<p>An Englishman will naturally be supposed to have more knowledge than a Dane, even if Tycho Brahe was Danish.</p>
<p>2 These national characters have moral and physical causes. Moral causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>affect the mind as motives or reasons, and</li>
<li>render certain manners habitual to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under moral causes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the nature of the government</li>
<li>the revolutions of public affairs</li>
<li>the wealth or poverty of the people</li>
<li>the nation&rsquo;s situation with regard to its neighbours,</li>
<li>and other similar circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical causes are the qualities of the air and climate, which insensibly:</p>
<ul>
<li>affect the temper and</li>
<li>alter the body&rsquo;s tone and habit.</li>
</ul>
<p>They give a particular complexion which reflection and reason may sometimes overcome. But it will still:</p>
<ul>
<li>prevail among the generality of mankind, and</li>
<li>have an influence on their manners.</li>
</ul>
<p>3 A nation&rsquo;s character will much depend on moral causes, since a nation is just a collection of individuals. The manners of individuals are frequently determined by these causes.</p>
<p>Poverty and hard labour debase the minds of the common people. It renders them unfit for any science and ingenious profession.</p>
<p>The oppression of any government has a proportional effect on their peoples' temper and genius. It banishes all the liberal arts from them.</p>
<p>4 Moral causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixes the character of the different professions</li>
<li>even changes the disposition which nature gives.</li>
</ul>
<p>A soldier and a priest are different characters, in all nations and ages. This difference is founded on circumstances which are eternal and unalterable.</p>
<p>5 The uncertainty of a soldier&rsquo;s life makes the soldier lavish, generous, and brave. Their idleness in large societies, such as camps or garrisons, inclines them to pleasure and gallantry. They acquire good breeding and an openness of behaviour by the frequent change of company. Being employed only against a public and an open enemy, they become candid, honest, and undesigning. They are commonly thoughtless and ignorant as they use more the labour of the body than that of the mind.</p>
<p>6 The priests of all religions are not the same. Yet, with most of them, their professional character always predominates over their personal character.</p>
<!-- The character of the profession will not always prevail over the  -->
<p>Chemists observe that when gases are raised to a certain height, become all the same, from whatever materials they be extracted.</p>
<p>Similarly, priests, being elevated above humanity, acquire a uniform character entirely their own. It is opposite to that of a soldier; as is the way of life, from which it is derived.</p>
<!-- I think it generally is not the most amiable one. -->
<p>7 I doubt physical causes. I do not think that men owe anything of their temper or genius to the air, food, or climate.</p>
<p>A contrary opinion might be at first sight seem probable since we find, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>these circumstances influence every animal, and</li>
<li>even those creatures fitted to live in all climates, such as dogs, horses, etc. do not attain the same perfection in all.
<ul>
<li>The courage of bull-dogs and game-cocks seems peculiar to England.</li>
<li>Flanders is remarkable for large and heavy horses.</li>
<li>Spain is remarkable for horses light, and of good mettle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When transplanted from one country to another, these creatures will soon lose the qualities which they derived from their native climate. Why not the same with men?</p>
<!-- 8 This is a very common question regarding human affairs.
So we should examine it fully.
 -->
<p>8-9 The human mind is of a very imitative nature. Men who converse often must acquire similar manners and share to each other their vices and virtues.</p>
<p>The propensity to company and society is strong in all rational creatures.
This disposition, which gives us this propensity, also makes us enter deeply into each other&rsquo;s feelings.
It causes similar passions to run by contagion through the whole club of companions.</p>
<p>A people united into one political body would have frequent dealings for defence, commerce, and government.</p>
<p>With the same language, they together acquire a resemblance in their manners, and have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a common or national character,</li>
<li>a unique personal character</li>
</ul>
<p>Nature produces all kinds of temper and understanding. But it does not follow that:</p>
<ul>
<li>she always produces them in the same proportions, and</li>
<li>the following ingredients will be mixed in the same way in every society:
<ul>
<li>industry and indolence</li>
<li>valour and cowardice</li>
<li>humanity and brutality</li>
<li>wisdom and folly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the infancy of society, if any of these dispositions are more common, it will naturally:</p>
<ul>
<li>prevail in that society, and</li>
<li>give a tincture to the national character.</li>
</ul>
<p>It could be presumed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>no character predominates, even in small societies, and</li>
<li>the same proportions will always be preserved in the mixture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet surely the persons in credit and authority are still fewer. It cannot always be presumed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are of the same character; and</li>
<li>their influence on the people&rsquo;s manners is always very considerable.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Brutus were made leader of a new republic and was enthusiastic about its liberty and public good, as to overlook all the ties of nature and private interest, it would naturally:</p>
<ul>
<li>have an effect on the whole society.</li>
<li>kindle the same passion in every bosom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever forms the manners of one generation, the next generation must imbibe a deeper tincture of the same dye. Men are more susceptible of all impressions during infancy. They retain these impressions for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>I assert that:</p>
<ul>
<li>all national characters, where they do not depend on fixed moral causes, proceed from such accidents as these, and</li>
<li>physical causes have no discernible operation on the human mind.</li>
</ul>
<!-- It is a maxim in all philosophy, that non-appearing causes are considered as not existing. -->
<br>
<h3 id="proofs-of-national-characters-coming-from-the-metaphysical-sympathy-of-manners-instead-of-from-physical-causes">Proofs of national characters coming from the metaphysical sympathy of manners instead of from physical causes</h3>
<p>10 Everywhere, and throughout history, there are signs of a sympathy or contagion of manners everywhere, but none of the influence of air or climate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11 Where a large government has been established for many centuries, it spreads a national character over the whole empire, and communicates to every part a similarity of manners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Chinese have the greatest uniformity of character even if their air and climate are very varied.</p>
<p><img src="" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>12 In small contiguous governments, the people have a different character. They are often as distinguishable in their manners as the most distant nations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Athens and Thebes just a short day&rsquo;s journey apart.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Athenians were remarkable for ingenuity, politeness, and gaiety</li>
<li>The Thebans were as remarkable for dullness, rusticity, and a phlegmatic temper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plutarch talked about the effects of air on the minds of men. He observed that the inhabitants of the Piraeum had very different tempers from those of the higher town in Athens, which was four miles away. But no one attributes the difference of manners in Wapping and St. James', to a difference of air or climate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13 The same national character commonly follows the authority of government to a precise boundary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon crossing a river or passing a mountain, one finds a new set of manners, with a new government.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Languedocians and Gascons are the gayest people in France</li>
<li>But when you pass the Pyrenees, you are among Spaniards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The changing air quality do not change exactly with the limits of an empire. Those limits depend so much on the accidents of battles, negotiations, and marriages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>14 Where any set of men, scattered over distant nations, maintain a close society or communication together, they acquire a similarity of manners and have little in common with the nations where they live in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the European Jews and the Armenians in the east, have a peculiar character. The Jews are as much noted for fraud, as the Armenians for probity.</p>
<p>The Jesuits, in all Catholic countries, are also observed to have a character peculiar to themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>15 If two nations inhabiting the same country are prevented from mixing with each other, they will preserve for several centuries a distinct and even opposite set of manners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This separation could be accidental, such as a difference in language or religion. The integrity, gravity, and bravery of the Turks, form an exact contrast to the deceit, levity, and cowardice of the modern Greeks.</p>
<p>16 The same set of manners will follow a nation, and adhere to them around the world, as well as the same laws and language. The Spanish, English, French and Dutch colonies are all distinguishable even between the tropics.</p>
<p>17 The manners of a people change very considerably from one age to another either by:</p>
<ul>
<li>great alterations in their government,</li>
<li>mixtures of new people, or</li>
<li>that inconstancy of human affairs</li>
</ul>
<p>The ingenuity, industry, and activity of the ancient Greeks have nothing in common with the stupidity and indolence of the modern Greeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Candour, bravery, and love of liberty formed the character of the ancient Romans.</li>
<li>Subtilty, cowardice, and a slavishness forms the character of the modern Italians.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The old Spaniards were restless, turbulent, and so addicted to war. Many of them killed themselves, when deprived of their arms by the Romans.</li>
<li>One would find an equal difficulty at present to rouse up the modern Spaniards to arms.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Batavians (Germans) were all soldiers of fortune. They hired themselves into the Roman armies. Their descendants use foreigners for the same purpose that the Romans did their ancestors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few strokes of the current French character is the same with the Gauls, as described by Caesar. Yet there is a big difference between the civility, humanity, and knowledge of modern France, and the ignorance, barbarity, and grossness of the ancient Gauls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a great difference between the modern British and those before the Roman conquest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- A few centuries ago, our ancestors were sunk into the most abject superstition.
In the last century, they were inflamed with the most furious enthusiasm.
Now they are most indifferent to religious matters, compared to any nation. -->
<blockquote>
<p>18 Where several neighbouring nations have a very close communication together, either by policy, commerce, or traveling, they acquire a similarity of manners, proportional to the communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, all the Franks appear to have a uniform character to the eastern nations.</p>
<p>The differences among them are like the peculiar accents of different provinces. Those accents are distinguishable only to an ear accustomed to them, and not to foreigners</p>
<p>19 We often see a wonderful mixture of manners and characters in the same nation, speaking the same language, and subject to the same government. The English are the most remarkable people in this sense.</p>
<p>This is not due to the uncertainty of their climate, or to any other physical causes, since all these causes take place in neighbouring Scotland, without the same effect.</p>
<p>A republican government commonly gets a peculiar set of manners, different from a monarchical one.</p>
<!-- , it is more apt to have peculiar manners. -->
<p>The imitation of superiors spread the national manners faster among the people. If the leaders are:</p>
<ul>
<li>mostly merchants, as in Holland, their uniform way of life will fix their character.</li>
<li>mostly nobles and landed gentry, like Germany, France, and Spain, the same effect follows.</li>
</ul>
<p>The genius of a particular sect or religion also moulds the people&rsquo;s manners.</p>
<p>The English government is a mixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. The people in authority are composed of gentry and merchants. All sects of religion are to be found among them.</p>
<p>The great liberty and independency, lets every man display his own peculiar manners. Hence, the English have the least of a national character<!-- , unless this very singularity may pass for such -->.</p>
<p>20 If men&rsquo;s characters depended on the air and climate, heat and cold should naturally have a mighty influence, since it has the greatest effect on all plants and irrational animals.</p>
<p>There is some reason to think that the nations which live beyond the polar circles or between the tropics are inferior and incapable of all the human mind&rsquo;s higher attainments.</p>
<p>Without having to recourse to physical causes, the following might account for this remarkable difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>the poverty and misery of the northern inhabitants of the globe, and</li>
<li>the indolence of the southern, from their few necessities,</li>
</ul>
<p>The characters of nations are certainly very promiscuous in the temperate climates.</p>
<p><strong>But almost all the observations of southern or northern people in these climates are false.</strong></p>
<p>21 If we say that closeness to the sun inflames men&rsquo;s imaginations and gives it a peculiar spirit and vivacity:</p>
<p>The French, Greeks, Egyptians, and Persians are remarkable for gaiety.
The Spaniards, Turks, and Chinese are noted for gravity and a serious deportment, without any such difference of climate as to produce this difference of temper.</p>
<p>22 The Greeks and Romans called all other nations barbarians.</p>
<p>They confined genius and a fine understanding to the more southern climates.
They said the northern nations were incapable of all knowledge and civility.
But our island has produced as great men, either for action or learning, as Greece or Italy has to boast of.</p>
<p>23 It is pretended that:</p>
<ul>
<li>men&rsquo;s feelings become more delicate as the country is nearer to the sun</li>
<li>the taste of beauty and elegance is proportionally improved per latitude, as we can observe of the languages.</li>
<li>the southern languages are smooth and melodious.</li>
<li>the northern languages are harsh and untuneable.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this observation is not universal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arabic is uncouth and disagreeable.</li>
<li>Russian is soft and musical.</li>
<li>Latin has a character of energy, strength, and harshness.</li>
<li>Italian is the most liquid, smooth, and effeminate language that can be imagined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every language will depend somewhat on the people&rsquo;s manners. <strong>But it will depend much more on that original stock of words and sounds, which they received from their ancestors. Those words and sounds remain unchangeable even if their manners change greatly.</strong></p>
<p>The English are presently more polite and knowing than the Greeks were after the siege of Troy. Yet is there no comparison between the language of Milton and that of Homer.</p>
<p>The greater the changes to the people&rsquo;s manners, the less changes can be expected in their language.</p>
<p>A few eminent and refined geniuses will communicate their taste and knowledge and produce the greatest improvements.
But they fix the tongue by their writings. They prevent, in some degree, further changes to the language.</p>
<p>24 Lord Bacon observed that the inhabitants of the warm south are generally more ingenious than those of the cold north. But where the native of a cold climate has genius, he rises to a higher pitch than can be reached by the southern wits.</p>
<p>A late writer confirms this by comparing the southern wits to cucumbers.</p>
<div class="squote" data-sal="slide-right">
They are commonly all good, but at best are an insipid fruit. While the northern geniuses are like melons. Not one in 50 is good, but when it is so, it has an exquisite relish.
</div>
<p>I believe this remark is just, when confined to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the European nations, and</li>
<li>the present age, or rather to the preceding one.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think it may be accounted for from moral causes.
All the sciences and liberal arts have been imported to us from the south.
The few who were addicted to them would:</p>
<ul>
<li>carry them to the greatest height, and</li>
<li>stretch every nerve and faculty to perfection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Emulation and by glory would prompt them to do so. Such a people would:</p>
<ul>
<li>spread knowledge everywhere, and</li>
<li>begot an universal esteem for the sciences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Afterwards, that industry relaxes when men:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not find suitable encouragement</li>
<li>are not given such distinction by their attainments</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning is then universally diffused among a people and banishes ignorance and rusticity. With everyone learned, people start to take learning for granted. The Dialogus de Oratoribus says that knowledge was much more common in Vespian&rsquo;s time than in the time of Cicero and Augustus. Quintilian also complains of the profanation of learning, by its becoming too common.</p>
<!-- People no longer attain that remarkable perfection in learning as before
Learning seems to be taken  in the .
It says  -->
<p>Juvenal says:</p>
<div class="squote" data-sal="slide-right">
"Formerly, science was confined to Greece and Italy. Now the whole world emulates Athens and Rome. Eloquent Gaul has taught Britain, knowing in the laws.  Even Thule entertains thoughts of hiring rhetoricians for its instruction."
</div>
<p>This state of learning is remarkable because Juvenal is himself the last of the Roman writers with any genius. Those who succeeded just had facts.</p>
<p>I hope the recent conversion of Russia to the study of the sciences will not end up like the present period of learning.</p>
<p>25 With regard to candour and sincerity, Cardinal Bentivoglio prefers the northern nations, such as the Flemings and Germans, to the southern, such as the Spaniards and Italians.</p>
<p>But I think that this has happened by accident.</p>
<p>The ancient Romans seem to have been a candid sincere people, as are the modern Turks.
But if this event arose from fixed causes, we may only conclude that all extremes:</p>
<ul>
<li>are apt to concur</li>
<li>are commonly attended with the same consequences</li>
</ul>
<p>Treachery usually accompanies ignorance and barbarism. If civilized nations ever embrace subtle and crooked politics, it is from an excess of refinement. It makes them disdain the plain direct path to power and glory.</p>
<p>26 Most conquests have gone from north to south.</p>
<p>That is why people have inferred that the northern nations are braver and fiercer. But it would be fairer to say that most conquests are made by poverty and a want on plenty and riches.</p>
<p>The Arabs left the deserts of Arabia. They carried their conquests north on all the fertile provinces of the Roman empire. They met the Turks half way, who were coming southwards from the deserts of Tartary.</p>
<p>Sir William Temple remarked that:</p>
<div class="squote" data-sal="slide-right">
all courageous animals are also carnivorous, and greater courage is to be expected in a people, such as the English, whose food is strong and hearty, than in the half-starved people of other countries.
</div>
<p>But the Swedes have disadvantages in food but are not inferior to any nation in terms of martial courage.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="mentality-creates-reality">Mentality Creates Reality</h2>
<p>28 In general, of all national qualities, courage is the most precarious because it is exerted:</p>
<ul>
<li>only at intervals, and</li>
<li>by a few in every nation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas industry, knowledge, civility, are used constantly and universally.</p>
<p>For several ages, these may become habitual to the whole people.
If courage be preserved, it must be by discipline, example, and opinion.</p>
<p>The tenth legion of Caesar and the regiment of Picardy in France were formed promiscuously from the citizens.
But having once entertained a notion that they were the best troops in the service, this very opinion really made them such.</p>
<p>29 The proof of how much courage depends on opinion can be seen in the Greek Dorians and Ionians.</p>
<p>The Dorians were always esteemed.
They always appeared more brave and manly than the Ionians, even if the colonies of both were interspersed and intermingled throughout:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greece,</li>
<li>Asia Minor,</li>
<li>Sicily,</li>
<li>Italy, and</li>
<li>the Aegean islands.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Athenians were the only Ionians that ever had any reputation for valour or military achievements. But even these were inferior to the Spartans, the bravest of the Dorians.</p>
<p>30 People shallowly observe that northern people prefer strong liquors while southern people prefer love and women. This observation is important.</p>
<p>This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>the cold climates require wine to warm the frozen blood and protect men against the weather.</li>
<li>the heat of the sun in southern countries inflames the blood and exalts the passion between the sexes.</li>
</ul>
<p>31 Moral causes can also contribute to it.</p>
<p>All strong liquors are rarer in the north. This makes them more coveted.</p>
<p>Diodorus Siculus tells us that the Gauls in his time were great drunkards. I suppose they were addicted to wine chiefly from its rarity and novelty.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the heat in the southern climates, obliges men and women to go half naked. It renders their frequent commerce more dangerous. It inflames their mutual passion.</p>
<p>This makes parents and husbands more jealous and reserved, which still farther inflames the passion. Not to mention, that women ripen sooner in the southern regions. It is necessary to observe greater jealousy and care in their education.</p>
<p>A 12-year old girl cannot possess equal discretion to govern this passion, with one who does not feel it strongly until she be 17 or 18.</p>
<p>The passion of love is:</p>
<ul>
<li>encouraged most by ease and leisure</li>
<li>destroyed most by industry and hard labour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Men in the warm climates have fewer necessities than in the cold ones. This circumstance alone may make a considerable difference between them.</p>
<p>32 I doubt that nature has, either from moral or physical causes, distributed these respective inclinations to the different climates.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks were born in a warm climate.</p>
<ul>
<li>They seem to have been much addicted to wine.</li>
<li>Their parties of pleasure were just drinking matches among men who passed their time away from the fair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Persia was even warmer. When Alexander led the Greeks into Persia, they multiplied their drinking matches in imitation of the Persian manners which honoured drunkards.</p>
<p>Cyrus the younger solicited the sober Spartans for succour against his brother Artaxerxes.
Cyrus claims it chiefly on account of his superior endowments, as more valorous, more bountiful, and a better drinker.
Darius Hystaspes made it be inscribed on his tomb-stone, among his other virtues and princely qualities, that no one could drink more than him.</p>
<p>You can get anything from the Negroes by offering them strong drink. For a cask of brandy, they will sell their children, wives, and mistresses.</p>
<p>In France and Italy, few drink pure wine, except in the hottest summer. The heat evaporates the spirits so it must be recruited by wine, just as it is necessary in Sweden to warm bodies congealed by winter.</p>
<p>33 If jealousy were regarded as a proof of an amorous disposition, the Russians are most jealous, before their contact with Europe changed this manner.</p>
<p>34 If it were true that nature physically regularly distributed the love of wine to the north and amorous love to the south, the climate may affect our bigger bodily organs than our finer organs which control the mind and understanding.</p>
<p>This is agreeable to the analogy of nature.
The races of animals never degenerate when carefully tended.
Horses, in particular, always show their blood in their shape, spirit, and swiftness.
But a vain man may have a philosopher son
A virtuous man may have a worthless son</p>
<p>35 The passion for liquor is more brutal and debasing than amorous love.</p>
<p>When properly managed, amorous love is the source of all politeness and refinement. Yet this gives not so great an advantage to the southern climates, as we might initially imagine.</p>
<p>When love goes beyond a certain pitch, it renders men jealous. It cuts off the free intercourse between the sexes, on which a nation&rsquo;s politeness will commonly depend.</p>
<p>People in very temperate climates are the most likely to attain all sorts of improvement.
Their blood is not so inflamed as to render them jealous.
Yet it is warm enough to make them set a due value on the charms and endowments of women.</p>
