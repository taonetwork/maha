          <p>We all know that physical reality exists inside space and time. But how were space and time created?</p>
<p>According to Physics, it was created through a Big Bang which started out as a Singularity that created matter and energy from nothing. So what is the nature of this  Singularity? No one is able to answer this.</p>
<p>Superphysics answers that the whole Big Bang paradigm is flawed in the first place because material creation did not originate from a material cause. Instead, it had metaphysical causes just as this <em>actual</em> website is caused <em>programatically</em> by HTML and CSS code. In other words, the material universe could not have been created by a material Big Bang, just as a website cannot create another website, or a novel created by another novel.</p>
<p>Instead, the physical universe was created from a metaphysical idea of what the universe should be. This is the same as a website being created from code-ideas, and a novel is created by the novelist&rsquo;s ideas.</p>
<p>The conversion of idea to reality follows a five-step process which we call our five-layer model, derived from the Greeks and Asians.</p>
<!-- spacetime is the second perceivable layer and is created by the relativistic interaction of quanta of spacetime (qost) on each other.  -->
<!--  must have mass., the discrete identity of gravity is contained in a few objects such as --> 
<!--  Physics has a belief that gravity comes from mass and so they do not really assign gravity or 'singularity' to planets.  -->
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/layersegl.png" alt="Science limited box"></p>
<p>In this model, space and time are the second layer and is subordinate to the aethereal. Examples aethereal things are minds, ideas, feelings, and the Higgs &lsquo;field&rsquo;. Thus, a universe with spacetime removed becomes the Mind of the Creator, which the Hindus call Brahma*. This is somewhat consistent with the Higgs particle being called the God-particle. We can also refer to it as a virtual reality Matrix, in reference to the movie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Brahma here just means the totality of whatever is existing.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3 id="the-universe-as-a-matrix">The Universe as a Matrix</h3>
<p>Instead of a Big Bang, it would be more proper to compare the creation of the universe as a Big Awakening or a Big Bootup, similar to how a computer converts static code-ideas into active virtual objects.</p>
<p>To be created, each object is assigned a place in the computer&rsquo;s memory as a block. A large app needs more memory and uses more blocks than a tiny app. Likewise, the universe is made up of such placeholder blocks which we call Quanta* of Spacetime or Qost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*This implies that Qosts are based on human perceptions. This means that animals or aliens might see stars and blackholes in a totally different way with different dynamics. This means that the definitions here work only for our current multiverse which we all perceive in a consistent way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, unlike a computer&rsquo;s memory that is limited and predefined, the qosts of the universe is infinite or rather is arbitrarily set by the aethereal layer above it (or operating behind it, just as a Firefox browser has the computer&rsquo;s operating system necessarily working behind the scenes). <!-- These qosts start out as 1-dimensional points that repel each other to create 2-dimensions, then 3-dimensions, and finally 4 physically-observable dimensions. --></p>
<p>Such points exert a natural force called gravity. Physics believes that gravity comes from material mass. However, this is impossible in our model since matter is the final 5th layer and doesn&rsquo;t exist yet at this point.</p>
<!-- and so dark matter has mass, but black holes and supermassive black holes have singularity wherein the laws of physics do not hold. To get rid of this absurdity, Superphysics views mass as coming from gravity in accordance with our five-layer model wherein material mass is the lowest and most subordinate layer. We can say that mass is the effect of, and is dependent on, gravity and its subordination to the aether, now known as the Higgs field.  -->
<p><strong>Thus, we define gravity as the inherent force in each qost which depends on the inherent quality of each.</strong> This inherent quality is defined by the aether above it, which is a totally different topic, just as electromagnetism is totally different from gravitation.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="the-qosts">The Qosts</h3>
<!-- (known in Physics as the Higgs field) -->
<p>The job or dharma of this gravitational force is to convert dynamic energy into static matter with the help of the three lower layers of radiant, radioactive, and material.</p>
<p>To do this, gravity emerges arbitrarily onto the aether (or out of the aether) as one-dimensional points or qosts which repel each other, for the same existential reason that mass and energy are conserved. This creates the concept of spacetime between each of the points.</p>
<br>

</div>

<br>
<p>The spacetime thus converts the 1-dimensional points into 2-dimensional and then into 3-dimensional nodes the more points are created. This continues until finally the nodes lead to 4 physically-observable dimensions* through the concept of time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*There can be up to 6 spacetime dimensions. Above that, spacetime no longer exists and experience becomes fully immersive and totally arbitrary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The qosts then attract energy in order to disrupt the homogenity of energy (equilibrium of thermodynamics) so that discrete identities can be created. These form energy clumps at the nodes which are then acted on by the other layers in succession:</p>
<ol>
<li>The electromagnetic forces turned the clumped energy into electrons or Quantum of Electricity (Qoe)</li>
<li>The weak force of the radioactive layer turned the electrons into neutrons</li>
<li>The strong force turned neutrons into protons as quarks (Quantum of matter or Qom) via gluons</li>
</ol>
<p>The protons then make up the basic elements which are then spread throughout space through the explosion of the qost, as a supernova. The exploded matter and unconverted energy are then re-clumped in the same qost to repeat the process until all the energy is converted into matter.</p>
<p>The exhausted qost manifests as a superpmassive blackhole, while its matter becomes its galaxy. Job done.</p>
<p>The exploded matter acquires a gravitational ability from the original qost, which then allows itself to gather other matter in order to become stars and planets. We can say that those astronomical bodies are also qosts:</p>

<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/quasar.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A quasar or reverse qost is a supermassive black hole that acts as a matter-to-energy recycle bin, allowing the universe to prevent a thermal death.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="stars-or-light-qosts">Stars or Light Qosts</h3>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/sun800.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A star is a young qost that is influenced by the radiant layer. It converts energy to matter and life (or active mind since everything is a mind).</p>
<br>
<h3 id="neutron-stars-and-pulsars-or-radio-qosts">Neutron Stars and Pulsars or Radio Qosts</h3>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/space.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A neutron star is an adult qost that converts matter into heavier matter and complex life and &lsquo;explodes&rsquo; it to the universe. It is influenced by the radioactive layer.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="black-hole-or-dark-or-dead-qosts">Black Hole or Dark or Dead Qosts</h3>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/blackholes800.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In Physics, a black hole is hole in the fabric of spacetime which has a singularity in its center. It is said that singularity is an area where the laws of physics break down, which is an absurdity.</p>
<p>To get rid of this absurdity, Superphysics instead calls it a dark qost which is a star (light qost) that has done its job of creating matter and will diffuse slowly into dark matter. Going into the center of a dark qost would be just like going to the center of any star.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="planet-or-primary-material-qosts">Planet or Primary Material Qosts</h3>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/mars.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A planet is a material qost that orbits a light qost as a sub qost. It may have its own subqosts as moons as secondary material qosts. Unlike light qosts, material qosts solidify into material bodies as a consequence of the influence of the material layer.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="dark-matter-or-remnant-qosts">Dark Matter or Remnant qosts</h3>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/palomar.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Dark qosts lose their identity and disperse themselves onto spacetime as remnant qosts. In computing, memory is finite and so virtual objects have to be cleaned up or &lsquo;garbage collected&rsquo; to give a chance for new objects to exist. But the universe is infinite and so the dark matter does not need to be recycled.</p>
<p>Recent proof of black holes decaying into dark matter is in the <a href="https://www.space.com/black-holes-overrun-star-cluster-palomar-5-star-cluster">Palomar 5 cluster</a> which is an ancient collection of stars that have turned to black holes that, in turn, will turn into dark matter and empty space.</p>

<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/darkmatter.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In this universe, the aether decided that gravitation must manifest as 1-dimensional points. In other universes within the multiverse however, the aether might decide for gravitation to manifest as 4-D blobs, 3-D planes, or 2-D lines. These then would create different spacetimes. However, the Superphysics would be the same.</p>

Three-dimensional solid geometry should have naturally followed two-dimensional geometry. But three-dimensional solid geometry is in such a ludicrous state. It made me pass over it, and go on to astronomy as the motion of solids.
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato</cite>
</div>
<p>This distinction between 2-D and 3-D geometry was the focus of Johanes Kepler and Kepler&rsquo;s laws which is the basis of our theory of gravitation which is opposite that of Newton and Einstein.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="so-whats-the-use-of-qosts">So what&rsquo;s the use of qosts?</h3>
<p>The practical use of qosts is to enable levitation and teleportation technologies that do not rely on lower layers such as radiant electromagnetism (EM) or material combustion. This will lead to cheaper and faster spacetravel that is impossible with the current material-combustion-fire-based technology.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/caveman.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/grav.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition, the perpetual creation of qosts leads to their mutual repulsion which can be tapped as a source of reliable energy. The proper control of qosts* will help make nuclear fusion controllable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*The qosts are subordinate to the aethereal layer and so they can be controlled from that layer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-are-the-proofs-that-such-technology-is-even-possible">What are the proofs that such technology is even possible?</h3>
<p>The disbelief of some people on such future technologies is similar to a caveman&rsquo;s disbelief that it would be possible for a human to see and talk to another human on the other side of the world. Such disbelief comes from the caveman&rsquo;s ignorance of electromagnetism, just as the modern human ignorance of gravitation leads to their disbelief of levitation, teleportation, and gravitational energy supply.</p>
<p>Our proofs for such future technologies is evidenced by four non-natural phenomena. These use the same principle as two galaxies which naturally increase the distance between each other:</p>
<ol>
<li>The abilities of UFOs to zip by and teleport nearly-instantly to other galaxies</li>
<li>The ability of Buddhist monks to levitate without any external energy source</li>
<li>The Egyptians lifting huge pyramid blocks without cranes</li>
<li>The Israelites making the walls of Jericho collapse (increase their gravity) via trumpets, without using any combustion or electric technology</li>
</ol>
<p>Two of these phenomena have been recorded on video:</p>

<p>The common reaction of disbelievers is to reject such evidence. But without such evidence, then there is no hope of ever developing such technologies that those very disbelievers would benefit from (just as everyone now benefits from electric power). It would be like cavemen preferring that all humans stay as cavemen instead of upgrading themselves into being able to create the internet, healthcare, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>This would happen if such caveman preferred easy skills such as hunting, gathering, and idol worship over advanced skills acquired many years from from preschool to university. The skillset for qost and aetherial technologies require much more education than what is currently available &ndash; it would require everyone to learn both Western and Eastern philosophy (subjective aspects of reality), on top of data science and all the fields of maths (objective aspects).</p>
<br>
<h3 id="mini-faq">Mini FAQ</h3>
<ol>
<li>What is the difference between a qost and a <a href="/solutions/material/how-to-fix-general-relativity">gravitational signature</a> (G)?</li>
</ol>
<p>A G is like a barcode sequence, while a qost is the ink that makes up the barcode.</p>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>Does this mean everything in the universe is a qost or a subqost?</li>
</ol>
<p>No. Qosts only apply from the spatial layer down to the material layer. The higher aether layer is not made up of qosts, but of qoas (quantum of aether) or identities that do not interact with gravity nor spacetime.</p>
<p>The most common example of qoas are ideas. The idea of love is not bound by spacetime. Nor does love attract people to it. Rather, the idea of love is the byproduct of the experience of the gravitation between two things that have the same frequency. Likewise, hatred is the idea of the repulsion of two entities.</p>
<br>
<ol start="3">
<li>How does qosts affect quantum physics?</li>
</ol>
<p>Quantum physics was invented before the advent of computers and virtual reality. Its fundamental concept is the &lsquo;field&rsquo; which came from electromagnetism (EM) of the 20th century. This field is bound by spacetime (the layer above EM).</p>
<p>The problem with the field-paradigm is that the qosts work <em>above</em> the EM layer. They work under the aether layer which is <em>NOT</em> bound by spacetime. <!-- In our computer analogy, the which is  or an abstract RAM of a computer instead of fields. --> This gives qosts and Material Superphysics more freedom than quantum physics on how to explain phenomena like gravitation and the collapse of probability into reality.</p>
<p>For example, Material Superphysics can easily have 6 or more dimensions just as a virtual machine (VM) can have a virtual machine inside it, which in turn can have VM&rsquo;s inside. In contrast, a quantum field cannot have fields in it that have subfields, since electromagnetism doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
