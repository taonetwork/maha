          <!-- Can't find a [WIMP of dark energy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/02/22/the-wimp-miracle-is-dead-as-dark-matter-experiments-come-up-empty-again/#95053e86dbc6)? That's because space isn't a thing that fills gaps between objects. Rather, it's just an effect of observation and is the same reason behind quantum non-locality.

Space-time depends totally on perception. Rather than say that it is infinite, it is more correct to call it as totally abitrary. A particle, when imposed on (since its 'spin' reflects reality), can therefore arbitrarily change its location and 'defy' gravity and locality.
 -->
<p>In Superphysics, physical existence is made when the aether arbitrarily creates <b>q</b>uanta <b>o</b>f <b>s</b>pace<b>t</b>ime or qost*, which are 1-dimensional points, within itself. Each point is a discrete and unique identity filled with an arbitrary amount of qualities as potentiality. These identities push each other to preserve their identity while innumerable qosts are created. The pushing leads to the creation and expansion of physical space, first as 2-dimensional and then into 3-dimensions. The sequence of expansion then leads to physical time as the fourth dimension, leading to 4-dimensional &ldquo;Minkowski&rdquo; spacetime to an observer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*pronounced as &lsquo;kost&rsquo;. This is supposed to be the graviton which will never be found, because it can only be felt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, spacetime is created by the mere existence or popping-in of the qosts from the aether. This gives the <strong>illusion</strong> of movement by one qost against the other when in fact, none of them are moving and the only real movement is their appearance into reality or actuality coming from nonreality or probability. The cause of spacetime therefore is the cognition of this appearance.</p>

<h3 id="replacing-einsteins-time">Replacing Einstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;Time&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Einstein defined time as the time that it takes for light to travel between two events in spacetime. But this is sophistical because we defined spacetime as the effect of the qosts creating distance between each other. His definition turns the effect as the cause which leads to sophistical theories of spacetime such as De Sitter, Taub-Nut, and Godel, etc. Since we exist in one universe, how can it have different spacetimes*?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*The theoretical and arbitrary spacetimes are a consequence of General Relativity which uses light as a measure of everything. The problem with this is that light is an electromagnetic wave which manifests in a field, of which the nature is arbitrary just as each wavelength has its own properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To create a single model for spacetime, we lay a maxim that the cause of all movement is internal, having two sources:</p>
<!-- > *Since this appearance is made by the act of cognition, then we can say that the movement comes from the actual observation.  is the  -->
<ol>
<li>The existence and qualities of the object for that layer</li>
<li>The cognition of the observer of the existence and qualities of that object</li>
</ol>
<p>These two make objects appear to move, depending on the rules of their layer and their relation to each other and to the observer. We can call this illusory movement in physical reality as &lsquo;relativistic physical movement&rsquo; which can be grouped into the five layers:</p>

<p>When combined with each other, together with the metaphysical relativity (not discussed here), these are called <strong>universal relativity</strong>. The only layer with external movement is the material layer. This manifests as a ball being moved by an external push, or a floating asteroid being moved by being hit by another asteroid.</p>
<!-- The movement is caused by the observer -->
<br>
<h3 id="spatial-relativity">Spatial Relativity</h3>
<p>Spatial Relativity is the ratio between the inherent quality of each qost. If Qost A has an inherent quality that is 100 units repulsive to Qost B, then the spacetime between them might be 100 distance-units per 1 unit of time-perception. But if Qost C is only 50 units repulsive, then Qost C will be 50 units away from Qost B at the same time. This would show Qost A moving faster away from Qost B than Qost C. In Physics, this manifests as it having a red-shift which will indicate a growing distance.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/qost.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This ratio* is called &lsquo;spatial relativity&rsquo; for the spatial layer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*In Pantrynomics, this manifests as real prices or the price of everything relative to grain.</p>
