          <!-- Pantrynomics uses economic social contracts as the tool of trade in order to circulate value to solve the following problems with the current 
 -->
<p>Both Economics and Mercantilism use money as their store of value and tool of trade. Mercantilism was also called the Commercial system and now takes the form of E-commerce.</p>
<p>To buy anything online, you need a credit card or any electronic system to transfer cash payments. Prior to commercialization, the universal method was barter. For example, the Mongols and the Inca were able to sustain their empires by bartering goods and services.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="how-the-commercial-system-spread">How The Commercial System Spread</h3>
<p>The Spanish discovered silver mines in South America which allowed metal money to spread to the world. Its convenience rendered barter obsolete. Because of colonization, all countries adopted precious metals, allowing the commercial money-only system to monopolize all buying and selling transactions.</p>
<p>However, it also created problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inefficiency in running an economy</strong>: Before you can buy bread, you need to have money. To have this money, you need to sell something that you have. To sell something, you need to find a market. So to buy anything, humans need three steps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High expense and unproductive labor in financing the economy or supporting money</strong>: The monopoly of money for exchange necessitates an expensive financial system filled with bankers, financiers, tellers, accountants, lawyers, etc. to support it. This adds to the cost of the economy without adding any real value. Adam Smith calls these &lsquo;unproductive labor&rsquo; and is the most expensive part of the economy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of responsiveness and slow progress</strong>: Since many steps are needed to procure money, there is a lag in responding to supply-and-demand opportunities. This results in missed opportunities for addressing the needs of society, or for creating advanced technologies as many promising research projects remain unfunded. A lot of deals fail because one party lacks money to complete the transaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve these problems, pantrynomics uses three kinds of stores of value, which we call &lsquo;tri-media stores&rsquo;, that are circulated via social contracts:</p>
<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
        <tr class="table-primary">
            <th>Kind</th>
            <th>Manifestation</th>                
            <th>Speed</th>
            <th>Reach</th>
            <th>Remarks</th>                                                                 
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
          <th class="table-secondary">Fiat</th>
          <td>Currency</td>
          <td>Fast</td>
          <td>National, International via Pool Clearing</td>
          <td>For normal transactions</td>                    
      </tr>
<!--       <tr>
          <th class="table-secondary">Gold</th>
          <td>Bullion</td>
          <td>Slow</td>
          <td>International</td>
          <td>For foreign investments</td>                    
      </tr> -->
      <tr>
          <th class="table-secondary">Barter</th>
          <td>Goods or Grains</td>
          <td>Slow</td>
          <td>International via Pool Clearing</td>
          <td>For transactions where currency is unavailable</td>                    
      </tr>      
      <tr>
          <th class="table-secondary">Grains</th>
          <td>Points</td>
          <td>Fast</td>
          <td>Local, Community, or City</td>
          <td>For procuring basic necessities and insurance</td>                    
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<p>For example, this system allows three ways to buy bread and get a haircut, different from the commercial money-only system that only allows money or money-based-credit:</p>
<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
        <tr class="table-primary">
            <th>Kind</th>
            <th>Commercial system</th>                
            <th>Pantrynomic system</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
          <th class="table-secondary">Buying bread</th>
          <td>use money</td>
          <td>use money<br>use points<br>barter anything that the baker wants</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <th class="table-secondary">Getting a haircut</th>
          <td>use money</td>
          <td>use money<br>use points<br>barter anything that the barber wants</td>
      </tr>      
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<!-- - To buy bread, you can barter directly with the baker as one step or do Pool Clearing as two or more steps (more on this later).
- The agreements need only be copied and notarized or be witnessed by an impartial third party
- The dealing parties are free to put whatever in the contract as long as it is within the law, as quickly as possible. They can rescind bad contracts and make new ones -->
<p>The question then arises: What will be the measure of value for such economic social contracts that use &lsquo;tri media stores&rsquo;?</p>
<!-- We base it on money as that will require a financial system which we had already abandoned.  -->
<p>Adam Smith asked the same question over 200 years ago: <!--  and came up with metals and grains which we update asthe effort theory of vaue. --></p>
<div class="squote smith">
<p>Labour.. is the only universal and the only standard by which we can compare the values of different commodities at all times and at all places. <!-- We cannot estimate.. the real value of different commodities from century to century by the quantities of silver which were given for them. We cannot estimate it from year to year by the quantities of corn. By the quantities of labour we can, with the greatest accuracy, estimate it both from century to century and from year to year. -->From century to century, corn is a better measure than silver, because, from century to century, equal quantities of corn will command the same quantity of labour more nearly than equal quantities of silver. From year to year, on the contrary, silver is a better measure than corn, because equal quantities of it will more nearly command the same quantity of labour.</p>
<cite>The Wealth of Nations Book 1 Chapter 5</cite>
</div>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nara/image/upload/q_auto/wheatfarm_bsqhxr.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The value of barter and points will be based on food-grains* which are more stable than fiat money. In this way, if a financial crisis or if a devaluation occurs, the economy can convert its value and exchanges into points. This will prevent a crash by creating a soft-landing. Buying and selling can be done in points or barter until money is restored to its natural value which represents the normal productivity and trade of society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Update Oct 20, 2021: The success of <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/14/asia/bali-plastic-exchange-rice-environment-cnnheroes/index.html">Plastic Exchange in Bali</a> is proof that such a grain-based system can work</p>
</blockquote>
<!--  especially for assets  
The problem with grains is that they are not easily transportable. So for consumer or short-term prices, precious metals such as gold bars will be used. Note that such bars are to be treated as commodities and not as money.

Both metals and grains are managed by warehouse supervisors and truckers instead of financiers and bankers. The agreements for buying bread will be measured in metals, while those for real estate will be based on either metals or grains.-->
<!-- > *Fiat money and cryptocurrencies are based on nothing but the promise of the issuer and so is very unstable and arbitrary. Gold, on the other hand, is a real thing that can be seen and touched by all and does not vanish like an arbitrary promise. Thus, taonomics advocates using future financial crises as a way to go back to the gold standard -->
<br>
<h3 id="are-grains-really-stable">Are Grains Really Stable?</h3>
<!-- ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/nara/image/upload/q_auto/oilcartoon_cpkylk.jpg) -->
<p>Adam Smith advocated wheat as the universal measure of long-term value because of its stability. The chart below shows that long-term prices of grain are more stable than those of oil or gold. Of the major commodities, oil has the highest price extremes while gold has the most volatile prices:</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nara/image/upload/q_auto/prices_s8q70o.png" alt=""></p>
<p>He also explained that the relative stability of grains over oil and metals is due to the fact that grains can be grown by anyone. The drilling of oil and the prospecting for gold, in contrast, can only be done by people who have the required capital and expertise.</p>
<div class="squote smith">
<p>..it may sometimes be of use to compare the different real values of a particular commodity at different times and places... We must in this case compare, not so much the different quantities of silver for which it was commonly sold, as the different quantities of labour which those different quantities of silver could have purchased. But the current prices of labour at distant times and places can scarce ever be known with any degree of exactness. Those of corn, though they have in few places been regularly recorded, are in general better known.. We must generally, therefore, content ourselves with them.</p>
</div>
<p>The stability of long term wheat prices is the major reason why Smith advocated land (or at least land rent) to be valued in wheat. Since all economies rely on land, the stability or fairness in the valuation of land will, in turn, lead to more stability in all other commodities, helping to prevent the severity of bubbles and crashes.</p>

<!-- ### Using Multilateral Pool Clearing to Circulate Goods and Services in an Economy

Now that we have a new tool of trade as agreements and a new measure or store of value as grains and the gold standard, we can now put them together into a new economic system that is scalable yet is more stable than the current one. The next post will explain how [pool clearing](/solutions/pantrynomics/how-multilateral-pool-clearing-can-solve-currency-crises) can be used to reduce inflation by sucking excess liquidity out of an economy or pumping it into a stagnating one.-->
<br>
<h3 id="grain-analytics-implementing-grain-based-valuation-via-points">Grain Analytics: Implementing Grain-based Valuation via Points</h3>
<p>This new system creates a whole new set of measures, transaction methods, and investment vehicles that fund productive labour directly and eliminate both inequality and employment:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/solutions/pantrynomics/multilateral-pool-clearing">Clearing Funds as an alternative to Bonds</a></li>
<li><a href="/articles/pantrynomics/the-alternative-to-gdp">Purchasing Power as an alterative to GDP</a></li>
<li>Basic Universal Revenue as an alternative to money</li>
<li><a href="/articles/pantrynomics/the-effort-theory-of-value">The Effort Theory of Value</a> as an alternative to Marginal Pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>The next post will explain how Grain-based Valuation can be implemented as Basic Universal Revenue. This will be very useful during <a href="/social/precrisis-years">the coming Great Stagflation</a> which is supposed to spark this year.</p>
