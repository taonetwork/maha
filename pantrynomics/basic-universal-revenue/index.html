          <p>Pantrynomics introduces the concept of resourcization or the use of resource credits which are social contracts that give right to assets or resources (products and services) in lieu of money.</p>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/resourcization.png" width="400px">
<p>The credits allow the unsold productivity of a slowing-down economy to be stored to avoid a crash, just as monetization does the opposite and speeds up an economy by converting productivity into money via sales.</p>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/monetization.png" width="400px">
<p>Resource credits are implemented generally through Basic Universal Revenue that will give nonmonetary rewards (as food) to productive people. This is similar to how the Inca established a nonmonetary economy using quipu that represented food.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/quipu.jpg" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>The Inca empire was able to sustain an economy without money nor writing</figcaption>
<p>Universal Basic Income (UBI) started to become popular in 2016 after it was adopted by a few Western countries. In general, studies have found two flaws in UBI:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contributes little to alleviate poverty as a whole</li>
<li>It is expensive to administer</li>
</ul>
<p>Adam Smith would be against UBI because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can only be measured in nominal value</li>
<li>It acts as an expense instead of as a capital.</li>
</ul>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>In towns principally supported by the residence of a court, the poor are chiefly maintained by the spending of revenue. The inferior ranks are generally idle, dissolute, and poor as in Rome, Versailles, Compiegne, and Fontainebleu.. In mercantile and manufacturing towns, the inferior ranks of people are chiefly maintained by the employment of capital. The inferior ranks are generally industrious, sober, and thriving.. It is better, says the proverb, to play for nothing than to work for nothing.</p>
<cite>The Simple Wealth of Nations Book 3</cite>
</div>
<!-- 
Neoliberals want UBI because it will give money to the poor who will then use it to buy goods and services of businesses. It increases sales and therefore profits, even if there is no assurance whether those poor people will spend it wisely. More importantly, it is guaranteed revenue for 
 -->
<!-- who lend the free money which otherwise would find no use in the bank's vaults. -->
<p>Development banks want UBI for them to find use for their idle money which is of no value when not circulating. UBI is an easy sign that the profits in lending are very low, that banks have to find radically new business models. Governments of democratic countries like Brazil and the Philippines want it because it lets them placate the poor and prevent public disobedience or the rise of Communism or terrorism. The abandonment of UBI in Finland and Bolsa Familia in Brazil are proofs that UBI is not sustainable.</p>
<!-- Canada and Finland, which are experimenting with UBI, are coincidentally the 4th and 5th largest gambling nations according to CNBC. Ontario, where UBI will be tested in Canada, also has the largest 2008 gambling revenue  of all the Canadian provinces. -->
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="what-would-smith-do">What Would Smith Do?</h3>
<p>Smith would rather be in favor of microfinance which are small loans, usually given to poor people to start a micro-business or cooperative. Loans are supposed to serve as one&rsquo;s capital, and thus, are not supposed to be spent recklessly as an expense. A capital pays for itself, but an expense does not.</p>
<p>There are generally two problems with microfinance, one with supply and another with demand:</p>
<ul>
<li>The demanders of loans are poor people who are deficient in practical skills like saving, diligence, hardwork, grit, problem solving, etc, otherwise they would not be poor in the first place. This could be caused by childhood development problems, bad environment, oppressive family or community members, and so on.</li>
<li>The banks might be predatory or inefficient especially in poor countries where the morals are low, law enforcement is not strict, or infrastructure is undeveloped.</li>
</ul>
<!-- To fix this problem, our system uses a profiling system called Match and a points-based valuation system called Basic Universal Revenue. These subsystems fix the fundamental problems of microfinance and universal basic income, which is the overreliance on money that only shows quantity and has no ability to show quality. These also prevent inflation and price volatility since there is no single currency to amass. -->
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="our-solution-a-basic-moneyless-system">Our Solution: A Basic Moneyless System</h3>
<p>Instead of using money as the store of value, our system uses grains since everyone needs to eat. If everyone can eat, then everyone can start creating goods and services. The more they are secure of having food for the future, the more they can throw themselves at whatever work they want. The more quantity and quality of work created, the more goods and services become available, and this leads to the real wealth of nations.</p>
<!-- **The question then becomes: If UBI doesn't work, then how can we solve poverty and inequality?**

Adam Smith points to the [effort theory of value](/articles/pantrynomics/the-effort-theory-of-value) as the secret sauce of his poverty-and-inequality-free system.
 -->
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/quipu.jpg" width="300px">
<figcaption>Adam Smith cited the Inca and Mongol civilizations as proof that large economies do not need currency to survive. The Inca used strings to represent food assets stored in community-granaries which were then traded for military service. Instead of strings, we use points. Instead of granaries, we use community hubs.</figcaption>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/mars.jpg" width="300px">
<p>It might not make sense to make food as the foundation of an economic system, now that food is plentiful. But it will make more sense when global warming and overpopulation starts making food less easy to come by. It will make the most sense in future human colonies in other planets where food is not guaranteed.</p>
<!-- 
> *The problem is that humans creatures are often lazy in mind and body and so wealthy societies often abandon work (cause) and just focus on wealth (effect). They start outsourcing their work to poorer countries and gamble with existing wealth in an effort to multiply it with zero effort. In time, the gambling creates financial crises, while poorer countries start to become wealthier and outsell the wealthy countries who have long lost the desire for hard work and merely want everything to come easy. This happened with the Roman Empire and Song dynasty outsourcing their military work to German and Mongol barbarians respectively, only to find themselves being ruled by those "uncivilized" people later on. The fact that the Great Britain outsourced their work to the American colonies and that the modern Americans outsourced their work to Communist China proves that this human propensity is still in force, and thus, is a principle observable in the human species throughout time and space. The dynamics of this principle will be explained further in Social Superphysics.

<h3 id="a-proper-store-of-value-is-needed-not-another-currency">A Proper Store of Value is Needed, Not Another Currency</h3>
<p>A shallow person might run with this idea and create a grain-based currency similar to local scrips or crypto that are convertible to a real commodity. However, this would merely allow the hoarding of that currency just as fiat is hoarded in the current system. Such a grain-currency would merely end up creating the same poverty and inequality.</p>
<p>The proper solution is to break apart the dual function of money and reduce it to two separate systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>one for the store of value</li>
<li>another for the tool of trade</li>
</ul>
<p>The store of value will be implemented as a resource credit system for deposting the value of work, while the tool of trade will be implemented as the claiming system that will convert the points into real goods or services. The resource credits then manifest as points that represent food.</p>
<p>In both depositing and claiming, the place of transaction, called a hub, will determine the point-value of the goods or services rendered. The competition between hubs ensures that the points will not be unfair, while the non-transferability of the points ensures that they cannot be amassed by any single person. Thus this points system, that is ultimately represented by grains, cannot be called a money or currency. Instead, we call this <strong>Basic Universal Revenue</strong> or BUR.</p>

<p>You can think of a baggage counter in a shopping center as an analogy to BUR. The counter lets anyone deposit their productivity in exchange for a tag that entitles them to claim the same productivity in the future, regardless of the changing value of fiat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it is unaffected by inflation, this makes it ideal for life insurance &ndash; the person will keep on depositing productivity in the counter and expect to get back the whole productivity undiluted by inflation.</li>
<li>Because the tags are not currency, the counter is not a banking system (yet). This makes bank-runs, financial crises, andtransaction mistakes  non-existent because unlike a bank that always must have money in reserve, a BUR hub is allowed to not have goods for certain time periods (such as during the time before harvest).</li>
<li>Unlike the banking system that increases wealth by multiplying the money that drives productivity, BUR increases wealth by tapping all of the untapped productivity in society, including even the animals that do productive labor, such as working cattle and dogs*.</li>
<li>Unlike the rationing system in Communist coutries, BUR can work without government, since it runs on the common interest of society**. People are free to choose other hubs if their current one gives an unfair valuation of their deposits.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>*Adam Smith mentioned that laboring cattle do productive work for humans and so should be entitled to wages</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>**David Hume mentioned that common interest is more fundamental than the social contracts that lead to laws and governments. This common interest is seen in the symbiosis of animals and in the ties that bind human families. Animals and families do not need written laws to be held together, but governments and countries do. This makes animal and family societies maintainable at lower cost than governments.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
<p>A bakery can make basic bread costing $1 each. Unemployed people can go to the bakery and claim one, giving 1 point to the bakery for each bread claimed. The bakery can then claim oven-fuel (such as gas) from the government in exchange for the points. The bakery can thus claim $1,000 worth of fuel if it gives out 1,000 bread, which it can use to bake for-profit bread to earn money. In effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>the bakery barters its bread for gas</li>
<li>the government barters its gas for social welfare</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
<p>A community pantry accepts plastic waste or compost collected by poor citizens in exchange for points. They can exchange the points for vegetables in the pantry. The waste is given then given to recyclers or urban farms who give money and vegetables to the pantry to maintain the system. In effect, the citizens barter their labor for vegetables through the pantry</p>

<h2 id="bur-as-a-stepping-stone-to-mulitlateral-clearing-and-resource-banking">BUR as a Stepping Stone to Mulitlateral Clearing and Resource Banking</h2>
<p>But what happens when a human moves from Country A to Country B? Can his productivity be moved with him?</p>
<p>BUR prevents arbitrary productivity-transfer in order to not let productivity get sucked away or be amassed by other people. This would have prevented the Asian Financial Crisis, 2008 Financial Crisis, the speculative attacks by George Soros, as well as the 2008 Food Crisis. But does this mean that foreign investments can never be made?</p>
<p>To answer this, we need to remember that BUR is only for basic needs such as food and healthcare (and possibly utilities). Its goal is to render as many people (and animals) productive so that they can eventually produce goods and services that go beyond the basics. As the people gain more productivity, they will naturally go outside of BUR and back into currency to buy more sophisticated goods and services.</p>
<p>If a person with a huge amount of BUR points in Poor Country P moves to a Rich Country R, then his points will have to be converted by an intra-national clearing system that converts the points to their proper productivity values. Such a system, called &ldquo;Pool&rdquo;*, will connect certain hubs in Country P to certain hubs in Country R. Only those hubs that are connected can transfer the points. To offset the cost of converting the points, those hubs, which we shall call &ldquo;Resource Banks&rdquo;, will offer a worse price than standalone hubs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*The idea for a clearing system that connects the resource banks is derived from the pool clearing proposal by EF Schumacher in 1943. The difference is that his system is &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; and uses local currencies, whereas BUR is &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;. In addition, our BUR-Pool system directly implements Adam Smith&rsquo;s free trade system that can work with or without money, which it replaces with points. This makes it even more resilient than the version proposed by EF Schumacher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, the bakery owner closes his business in Country P to move to Country R. If he has 1,000 points, then these will be converted to 900 points in Country R to help him have fuel to start his business. The 100 points lost is credited to the Resource Bank who transfers his data and checks with the local government in both countries.</p>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/burpool.png" width="300px">
<figcaption>Basic Universal Revenue, Resource Banks, and Pool Clearing unify the productivity of all countries via common interest, which is the opposite of the competition in the commercial system derived from selfish interest</figcaption>
<!-- In 2015, my model predicted a 10+ year crisis period sparking in 2019, divided into three waves. The first wave turned out to be Covid. The second wave is supposed to be a global money crisis, and the third one will be some kind of conflict. While BUR is designed forthe current Covid recession, Pool is designed for that future money crisis. Had BUR been in place in 2019, then the Covid pandemic wouldn't have caused huge budget deficits as points could've been given out instead of cash. But in hindsight, had there been no Covid relief bill in many countries, then there would be no future monetary crisis. Without that second crisis, there would be no way to prove that a Pool clearing system would be more beneficial than the current commercial system. -->
<p>BUR can thus be seen as the third trade-tool in our proposed pantrynomic system that prevents poverty, inequality, recessions and economic crises:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first tool is money-payment which stores the value in fiat</li>
<li>The second tool is barter contracts which will usually manifest as job contracts, storing value as skill or labor</li>
<li>The third tool is points-based as BUR, storing value as grains</li>
</ol>
<p>The best thing about it is that it can be extended with Pool Clearing to unify the national economies of countries so that they can provide for each other, such as by paying for the national debt of the other through their imports.</p>
