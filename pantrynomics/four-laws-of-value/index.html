<p>I shall endeavour to explain [exchangable value] as fully and distinctly as I can for which I must very earnestly entreat reader's patience and attention: his patience in order to examine something which might appear unnecessarily tedious; his attention to understand what may, perhaps, after the fullest explication which I am capable of giving of it, appear still obscure. I am always willing to run some hazard of being tedious in order to be sure that I am perspicuous; and after taking the utmost pains that I can to be perspicuous, some obscurity may still appear to remain upon a subject in its own nature extremely abstracted.</p>
<cite>Book 1, Chapter 3 of The Wealth of Nations</cite>
</div>
<p>Pantrynomics falls under <a href="/social">Social Superphysics</a> which is a paradigm that sees reality as <a href="/articles/social/collective-wave-of-desire">waves manifesting as particles</a>. This is different from science which prefers particles* over waves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*However, that paradigm seems to be changing as proven by electrons nowadays being regarded as a probability cloud instead of as a material point</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3 id="value-vs-price">Value vs Price</h3>
<p>These waves in economics manifest as &lsquo;value&rsquo; which are the abstract feelings of worth (from Latin valere). This worth is ability of a perception to produce usefulness, pleasure, or reduction of pain or stress.</p>
<p>Particles in economics manifest as &lsquo;prices&rsquo; (from Latin pretium or reward or prize). These are objective ideas of worth, manifesting as a discrete number.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can imagine value as a fluffy cloud with no specific boundaries, or as water in a stream that also isn&rsquo;t contained as a single object.</li>
<li>You can imagine price as a cotton ball that has been compressed as to give it a specific shape, or as a water in a glass that has a specific measure, such as 100mL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economics is full of specific numbers as GDP, population size, unemployment rate, trade deficit, etc. but only has a few concepts of value.</p>
<p>The economic value of a bridge, for example, is more abstract than its cost-price.</p>
<ul>
<li>The economic value has a range such as $1b t0 $1.5b over 10 years</li>
<li>It cost price is a specific number such as $100m, paid in 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>Value thus has the same dynamics as fluctuating waves, while price has the dynamics of fixed particles. Value is more fundamental* than prices just as waves are more fundamental than particles. If value were a moving desire-entity, then price would be a snapshot of that desire taken at a certain time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*This is proven by the Japanese character for value and those for price 値段. Fundamental perceptions like person 人 and day 日 get one character, while their derivative ideas like Chinese person 中国人 and Monday 月曜日 have characters added to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/prices.jpg" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>Prices depend on the perceiver's mind, which makes it ultimately a metaphysical issue, which is an exerptise of pantrynomics as 'Economic Superphysics'</figcaption>
<p>We can say that value is the cause, and price is just the effect*.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Socrates calls them shadows</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can hand out prizes such as trophies, but not the value that they represent such as being brightest in class. It is possible to buy an award, yet not be worthy of it.  The engine of value is desire. <!-- The cause of value therefore is the feeling called 'desire', of which the strongest is the ego or the feeling or desire of the self. --></p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/price.jpg" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>Pantrynomics, as a subset of Social Superphysics, implements these wave-particle principles as values and prices</figcaption>
<p>This desire is a product of the mind and thus exists in the metaphysical dimension.</p>
<p>Its physical counterpart is physical energy as heat, calories, joules, etc.</p>
<p>The rules for physical energy are described as <strong>the Four Laws of Thermodynamics</strong>. We carry over these laws onto pantrynomics as <strong>the Four Laws of Value</strong> which operate on human desire*.</p>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>the metaphysical dimension has desire, with its dynamics explained by the four laws of value</li>
<li>the physical dimension has energy, with its dynamics explained by the four laws of themodynamics</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>*This means that the animal and plant kingdoms have their own pantrynomic laws, which are out of the scope of our current pantrynomics, that dictate how they allocate resources among themselves to quench their desires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Celsius degrees in thermodynamics then manifest as dollar prices in pantrynomics. This lets us fit <a href="/articles/pantrynomics/pantrynomics-textbook/">all the principles of pantrynomics elegantly under four headings</a>. This is different from the messy organization of Economics as micro-macro-economics, behavioral, political economy, development economics, etc.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="the-first-law-of-value-everything-has-a-value-as-nominal-prices">The First Law of Value: Everything has a Value as Nominal Prices</h3>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/icons/1law.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Our First Law of Value is derived from the Third Law of Thermodynamics which says that absolute zero temperature is impossible to reach or maintain*. This translates to pantrynomics as every thing in the universe having value, otherwise it would not exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*In Medical Superphysics, this manifests as everything being able to affect a person&rsquo;s health in varying degrees. In Supersociology, this manifests as everyone having a value to society</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. A might not see value in a cake, but Mr. B might, as he might want it for his wife&rsquo;s birthday tomorrow. The value of the cake to Mr. B is then due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>his inherent dharma or tao of giving gifts during birthdays, and</li>
<li>the tao of the cake as being a kind of gift. In contrast, an iguana does not have the tao of being a gift, and so Mr. B would not assign value to an iguana, except if his wife were an Iguana-lover (had the tao of loving iguanas). This tao is not present in Mr. A and so he sees no value in the cake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, value is always relativistic to the general society and the personal self, just as energy has a general and special relativity.</p>
<p>This value is called <strong>use-value</strong> or utility value in Economics. Pantrynomics allows sentimental value, but since the mechanism to objectively compare sentiments is not yet established*, we shall stick to use-value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*We&rsquo;re working on that too</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the cake is baked by Mr. Chef, then Mr. B would want to acquire the cake by buying it and by offering a <strong>nominal price</strong>. This price is a kind of exchangeable value from the perspective of the buyer.</p>
<p>We can plot the relationships created by this law, as well as the supply and demand model that it creates, below:</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/1.png" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>The first law of value creates the downward sloping demand curve for both pantrynomics and Economics</figcaption>
<br>
<div class="box card p-4 bg-dark text-white">
<h3 class="text-white">The Paradox of Value in Economics Leading to Sinister Profit Maximization</h3>
Economics uses the difference between use-value and nominal exchangeable value to create a non-problem called the "paradox" of value. This paradox states that water is essential to life and has a high use-value, but is nominally cheap. Diamonds, on the other hand, are nominally expensive but have low use-value. So economists create the concept of marginal utility to "solve" the paradox.<br><br>Marginal utility would say that the frequent consumption of an item, such as water, reduces the utility or use-value of that item. Therefore, to make it more valuable, its consumption should be limited. For example, if we drink 4 liters of water everyday, then we will appreciate water twice more if we only had 2 liters daily. This would then raise its use-value and subsequently its nominal exchangable value to be more like diamonds. <br><br>This then leads to its child concept called utility or profit maximization that would urge us to sell this scarce water to get more nominal revenue and riches for ourselves. We should find a sweet spot via maximization wherein we can cut the supply of water to give us higher revenues, but not too much that it would kill our market (by dying from thirst, for example). All of this is morally absurd, yet this is what Economic Calculus teaches. This can be seen most commonly in the prices of oil, utilities, medical services, and real estate which everyone needs.<br><br>To Adam Smith and pantrynomics, <b>use-value should not be compared to exchangeable value</b> just as apples should not be compared to oranges. This is because use-value is personal while exchangeable value is social. Without the comparison, no paradox is created and no profit maximization, artificial scarcity, and social suffering is created for personal gain. 
</div>
<br>
<h3 id="the-second-law-of-value-the-invisible-hand-of-the-tao-as-real-prices">The Second Law of Value: The Invisible Hand of the Tao as Real Prices</h3>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/icons/2law.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The First Law of Value introduced Exchangeable Value which is seen as Nominal Price to the Buyer. The Second Law of Value introduces <strong>Real Price</strong> which is the Exchangeable Value to the Seller.</p>
<ul>
<li>Real value is the value of the effort, trouble, hardship, and sentimentalism that is put into the Item by its owner or seller. This leads to the Effort theory of value of Adam Smith, which is opposite of the Labor theory of value of Karl Marx</li>
<li>Nominal value is the value of the Item to its buyer/s who may or may not have idea of its real value to its owner</li>
</ul>
<p>The Second Law of Value states that value goes from areas with high value to areas with low value in order to spread out the value and remove the lack in society. This mirrors the Second Law of Thermodynamics that states that energy goes from hot to cold to equalize the heat, or that organized systems become unstable as time passes.</p>
<p>The instability is a sign of Nature’s inherent dynamism* and manifests as the concept of <b>Absolute Demand</b> in pantrynomics, which does not exist in Economics. This demand manifests as the arbitrary motives such as profit, duty, conservation, benevolence, the force of capital, goal-in-life, etc. as part of the personal interest. This is different from Economics which enshrines only the profit motive as the selfish interest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*In Medical Superphysics, this dynamism or entropy manifests as the mind jumping to conclusions unless it is restrained by conscience. In Supersociology, this manifests as popular opinion turning into mob rule unless it is restrained by the common interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the cake example above, let us assume that the cake was baked by Mr. Chef for 2 units of effort. To bake the same cake, it will take Mr. C, D, and E 4, 6, and 8 units of effort respectively. And so they each assign a nominal price of $4, $6, and $8 for the cake.</p>
<ul>
<li>If Mr. Chef overvalues his effort and sells the cake at $10, then he will not be able to sell it</li>
<li>If he sells it at $8, then he can make 4 more tomorrow at $8 each, only to find no more sales since only Mr. E could afford it and he had already bought one</li>
<li>If Mr. Chef sells it at $2, then he can only make 1 more tomorrow and it would take him 3 days to satsify all demand</li>
</ul>
<p>So through trial and error, he sets his nominal price to $4. In this way, his first sale will let him make two more, and all demand can be satisfied in 2 days. His net nominal revenue will be $4 in the end.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/2.png" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>The second law of value creates a downward sloping supply curve in pantrynomics. In Economics, it is limited to the profit-motive which causes its supply curve to slope upwards. While the concept of nominal value exists in Economics, real value does not. For example, Real GDP is still measured in money and not in commodities</figcaption>
<p>The Pantrynomic supply curve is very different from the profit maximizing one of Economics which will sell the cake at a higher price of $6. This will:</p>
<ul>
<li>create 3 cakes on the second day</li>
<li>1 will be sold, leaving 2 unsold yet Mr. C would not be able to afford any of it</li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario leads to the same $4 net revenue, with one customer left unsatisfied because of the higher price.</p>
<p><strong>This leads to artificial problems in demand and supply</strong> where food is wasted yet many people, who have some productivity to offer and are not worthless, stay hungry. The alarming thing is that people pay to get into university to be taught such things that create such problems!</p>
<p>In contrast, the non-profit-maximizing system of pantrynomics earns through <strong>primary arbitrage</strong> or through the differences in hardship incurred in making a product or service.</p>
<p>In the example, Mr. Chef is able to make quality cakes at low effort because of his great skill in making them. <strong>His profit is from increasing his mastery which lowers his costs, and not in stifling supply by raising prices.</strong>  His mastery can be achieved faster if he were passionate in his chosen business or employment. This is why we call the Second law of Value as the <a href="/pantrynomics/invisible-hand-of-tao">Invisible Hand of the Tao</a> that shows itself through <a href="/articles/pantrynomics/the-effort-theory-of-value">the effort theory of value</a>.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="the-third-law-of-value-exchange-as-market-prices">The Third Law of Value: Exchange as Market Prices</h3>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/icons/3law.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In order to address all the demand in society, supply has to be exchanged through a medium. This creates the Third Law of Value which states that value is transferred through exchange whether it be through money, barter, points, promises, etc. This mirrors the First Law of Thermodynamics, known as the law of conservation of energy*. That law states that energy cannot be destroyed. Instead, it merely changes forms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*In Medical Superphysics, this manifests as the transference of properties to the body of whatever is affecting health. In Supersociology, this is the feelings of members of society affecting other members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exchange exists in both Economics and pantrynomics. The latter, however, allows more mediums of exchange as fiat, barter, and points. In our cake example, the cake baked by Mr. Chef changed form into $4 after selling it. The $4 is called the <strong>market price</strong> which is the actual price that the item is exchanged. Unlike the nominal price that might vary from customer to customer, the market price is applied to all customers.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/3.png" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>Unlike pantrynomics, Economics does not limit arbitrage with real prices, and so there is nothing stopping bubbles from forming</figcaption>
<!-- A change in the nominal value comes from the difference between the nominal price and the market price, leading to the real price and real value(these concepts are not all present in Economics). This creates transaction systems such as cash, credit, barter, andresource credits. Under this law are supply and demand, monetary theories (money supply, inflation, etc) and the double coincidence of wants of barter. -->
<!-- We then input these laws according to our eagle equation in order to create our ‘equation’ for demand and supply as ps:pdD. This overturns the mercantilist ‘Law’ of Supply and Demand of Economics which treats of s and d as equals:
 -->
<p>While the Second Law spreads value through primary arbitrage, the Third Law spreads it through secondary arbtirage or the difference between the market price and the natural price, which will be explained next. We can say in a sense that primary arbitrage is wholesale while secondary arbitrage is retail.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="the-fourth-law-of-value-economic-balance-as-natural-prices">The Fourth Law of Value: Economic Balance as Natural Prices</h3>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/icons/4law.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If the market price is the nominal price that is applied on all customers for some time, then the <strong>natural price</strong> is the lowest common real price from all suppliers over time, assuming that the three prior laws were observed and there is a sense of community instead of profit maximization.</p>
<p>This is established by the Fourth Law of Value which says that there must be balance in any economy, whether it be a family, company, or nation. This mirrors the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics that has the concept of thermal equilibrium* leading to temperature. This concept does not exist in Economics because profit maximization prevents it. This is why modern economic systems have recurring crashes through the violation of this natural law of value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*In Medical Superphysics, this manifest as the balance between things that affect our health to maintain an equilibrium as good health. In Supersociology, this is balance of giving value to all classes of society in order to maintain stability and prevent revolutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our cake example, let us assume that Mr. Chef baked the same kind of cake at a real price depending on the cost of ingredients for each day of the week:</p>
<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-hover">

</div>
<p>The Natural Price would be $4, representing the most frequent and low real price, assuming that profit maximization was not observed.</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
The natural price is the lowest..he is likely to sell them for any considerable time.. [It is]..the central price, to which the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating... The market price..is regulated by the proportion between the quantity..actually brought to market, and the demand of those who are willing to pay the natural price.
</div>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In pantrynomics, the balance between market and natural prices is checked through a grain index which compares the prices of commodities relative to the common grain eaten by the people. Even without a grain index, people will naturally feel the imbalance in the economy and start to protest if the increase in market prices no longer keep their ratio to the natural prices. Such an unnatural increase would occur if there were excessive primary arbitrage as monopoly of production or secondary arbitrage as monopoly of distribution.</p>
<!-- distribution or retail of the produced goods and services were stifled by excessive secondary arbitrage.   -->
<p>Modern Economics has no concept of natural price and so there are often wild fluctuations in prices in modern economic systems which allow maximum profits, but also losses.</p>
<br>
<p>We can now make a table for the four classifications of Exchangeable value in pantrynomics, using &ldquo;price&rdquo; as its snapshot:</p>
<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
        <tr class="table-primary">
            <th>Pantrynomics</th>
            <th>Personal</th>
            <th>Society</th>                
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Subjective and Variable (Buyer's perspective)</td>
          <td>Nominal Price (value in currency)</td>
          <td>Market Price (value to the buyer)</td>          
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Objective and Natural or Invariable (Seller's perspective)</td>
          <td>Real Price (value in grain or labour)</td>
          <td>Natural Price (value to the seller)</td>          
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<br>
<p>This is in contrast to Economics which has no concept of Real and Natural Price as it would prevent arbitrage and profit maximization. It only has economic value (nominal price) and market value (market price):</p>

<p>In addition, we can see how the four law of value are the reverse of the laws of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>For example, the Zeroth law or the balancing of temperature is the first in Physics, but is the last in pantrynomics as economic balance of the Fourth law. Likewise, the Third law, as absolute zero, is the last in Physics, but is the first in pantrynomics as its First law, as everything having a value.</p>
<p>This is because Physics believes that the universe began as an energetic Big Bang, whereas humans start from birth or low-energy sleep.</p>

<h3 id="primary-and-secondary-abitrage">Primary and Secondary Abitrage</h3>
<p>The social end result of the journey from nominal to real to natural value is therefore market value. In the past, this was done through barter, giving more power to real value, the primary producers, and primary arbitrage. This led to specialization which manifested as the class or caste system in ancient India, Egypt, and China.</p>
<p>The invention of money sped up the exchange but shifted the power to market value, the merchant-retailers, and secondary arbitrage. To get even more revenue, the merchants advocated profit maximization which overshadowed real value and the natural price. Mercantilism and the Commercial system was born. Mercantilism became Economics and the Commercial system became e-commerce and commercial banking.</p>
<p>Economics uses only secondary arbitrage which enriches only the retailers: speculators, brokers, stock markets, job agencies, outsourcers, and the financial system. Pantrynomics, on the other hand, uses both primary and secondary arbitrage to enrich both the retailers and the artists, producers, farmers, workers, and freelancers themselves. Pantrynomics tries to discover the hidden value of everyone in order to increase their primary arbitrage and increase the real productivity and value in society.</p>
<p>Having two arbitrages ensures that a <em>pantrynomy</em> will be more dynamic than an economy. In fact, Smith predicted that people will work so hard in such a system that caps on revenue would have to be decreed to protect the people&rsquo;s health:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
Our soldiers are not the most industrious people. Yet when they are liberally paid by the piece, their officers were frequently obliged to stipulate that they should not be allowed to earn above a certain rate every day. Before this stipulation, soldiers frequently overworked and hurt their health by mutual emulation and the desire of greater gain.

<p>This productive pantrynomic system will be essential in helping societies rise up from the ashes of the debt and decline from Covid.</p>

<li>Edit 4/2017: added Economics value matrix.</li>
<li>Edit 8/2020: overhauled to match Superphysics</li>
<li>Edit 7/2021: overhauled to base everything on the four laws</li>
</ul>
<!-- We then input these laws according to our eagle equation in order to create our 'equation' for demand and supply as ps:pd<sup>D</sup>. This overturns the mercantilist 'Law' of Supply and Demand of Economics which treats of s and d as equals:

*Our eagle equation for all kinetic movementfits into both the Third Law of Thermodynamics and the Third Law of Value. The image above is for potental movement (I noticed that some physicists tend to be very fussy about the difference between potential and kinetic energy)*

We find that these four laws match the four factors of our [DCIT model](/posts-pantrynomics/the-demand-capital-industry-trade-model/) which is made up of:

| **Factor** | **Law of Value** | **Value** | **Model** | **Physics equivalent** | **Pantrynomic system** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demand | First | Natural Price | GPFY | Higgs Field | Basic Universal Revenue <br> as store of value <br> and the Grain Index | Basis of economic justice <br> which is lacking in both <br> Capitalism and Communism |
| Capital | Second | Real Price | GUE | Gravitation (we gravitate <br> towards certain interests <br> based on our dharma) | Effort Theory of Value <br> ISAIAH Match | Leads to economic democracy <br> and maximized non-commercial potential|
| Industry | Third | Nominal Price <br> (value in currency) | GGAMS | Strong Layer | Real Price via <br> the Economic Table | Economic balance or stasis <br> that is lacking in Capitalism |
| Trade | Fourth | Market Price <br> (value to the buyer) | GRID | Electroweak | Exchange systems with maintenance cost | Regulates merchants as <br> the opposite of Mercantilism |
