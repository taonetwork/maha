          <!-- That’s because Economics was built by businessmen for businessmen. Firms can raise prices at will, but you can’t ask for a raise each time prices rise. In the 17th century, they advocated a system called Mercantilism to enrich themselves. Mercantilism then mutated into neo-classical Economics via the Marginal Revolution of the 1870’s to enrich themselves with the mercantile ideas of the law of supply and demand, profit maximization, and selfish-interest. This new science created the Roaring 20s and, consequently, the Great Depression and World War II. -->
<p>The biggest fallacy of Economics is Market Equilibrium which is taught in basic economics or &lsquo;Econ101&rsquo; everywhere as the supply and demand curve forming an &lsquo;X&rsquo; and meeting in a state called &lsquo;exact equilibrium&rsquo;. Smith exposed this as mercantile sophistry in the 18th century, then called the &lsquo;balance of trade&rsquo;. To prove that this idea of &lsquo;balance&rsquo; is the same in essence with the &lsquo;equilibrium&rsquo; of economics, let&rsquo;s compare the philosophy behind both ideas.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/equilibwrong.png" alt="suppy demand fallacy"></p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="samuelsons-version-of-the-law-of-demand">Samuelson&rsquo;s Version of The Law of Demand</h3>
<p>Modern Economics began with Paul Samuelson&rsquo;s neo-classical synthesis which described a downward sloping picturization of the &lsquo;Demand Schedule&rsquo;*. It means that the price of a thing goes down the more abundant it is:</p>
<div class="squote sam" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>When the price of a good is raised (at the same time that all other things are held constant), less of it is demanded.</p>
<cite>Paul Samuelson, Economics, Chapter 4 Supply and Demand: The Bare Elements, page 61</cite>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>*Instead of a demand schedule, pantrynomics uses the modern economic table of the Physiocrats to determine the real price of everything in real-time. If everyone knows the real price of everything, then information asymmetry and profit maximization stop existing. Consequently, economic crises no longer have a chance to form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/demsup/eq1.png" alt="Downward Demand Curve"></p>
<p>He then goes through a few more paragraphs to prove this. Smith uses only four sentences to explain this from the viewpoint of an impartial spectator (not as a buyer nor seller):</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange. On the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce any thing; scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it.</p>
<cite>Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations, Book 1, Chapter 4</cite>
</div>
<br>
<p>Like Smith, Samuelson also gives the example of water. However, Samuelson&rsquo;s version <strong>observes this phenomenon from the viewpoint of business or the supplier first</strong> instead of the buyer or demander. This is important because in reality, the buyers are made up of people in society. This subtle fact might not catch the attention of a casual reader, but it can be seen by a dialectician (a non-shallow philosopher).</p>
<div class="squote sam" data-sal="slide-right">
Thus a first reason for the validity of the law of downward-sloping demand comes from the fact that lowering prices brings in new buyers.
<cite>Economics, page 61</cite>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="the-mercantile-version-of-the-law-of-demand">The Mercantile Version of the Law of Demand</h3>
<p>Smith points to Thomas Mun&rsquo;s <a href="/research/mun/englands-treasure">England’s Treasure on Foreign Trade</a>  as the origin of equilibrium, so we look for Mun&rsquo;s version of the demand curve.</p>
<div class="squote" data-sal="slide-right">
By lowering the price of our cloth in Turkey, we have sold more. The Venetians have lost because theirs is dearer. When our cloth was expensive, we lost at the least half our clothing to foreigners. 25% lower prices raises sales by over 50%, to the public benefit. When our cloth is expensive, other nations sell more cloths. When our cloth is cheap, they lose business. We therefore should increase the sale of our cloth.
<cite>Thomas Mun, Simple England's Treasure, Chapter 3</cite>
</div>
<p>Plotting this, we get the same downward sloping demand curve. We thus prove that Samuelson, Smith, and Mun agree on a downward sloping demand curve:</p>

<div class="box">
<h3>Digression on the 'Law' of Demand: Creating the non-problem 'paradox of value' to justify the fallacy called Profit Maximization</h3>
<small>Feb 2017</small>
<p>Many economists, including Samuelson, cite Smith’s example as a &lsquo;paradox of value&rsquo;, where in fact, there was never a paradox to Smith. Anything that is difficult to obtain yet desired by the mind, such as diamonds, simply will naturally have a higher price than that which is easy to obtain, like water. Economists create a paradox in order to justify the creation of the concept of marginal utility to ‘solve’ the paradox. This marginal utility requires the quantification of pleasure or utility, which is then ‘maximized’ as ‘profit maximization’ &ndash; the second key fallacy being perpetrated by Economics.<br><br>By destroying the paradox of value, then value is properly kept as subjective instead of being objectified into numerical increments. This will then make profit maximization lose its top importance in the minds of businessmen and people in general. This then will make businessmen, investors, and entrepreneurs shift their focus on the actual non-numerical, non-quantifiable benefits that their businesses create.</p>
<!-- Profit Maximization Fallacy
Profit maximization teaches businessmen to supply less, even if society needed more -->
</div>
<br>
<h3 id="the-supply-curve-of-monopoly">The Supply Curve of Monopoly</h3>
<p>We see that the demand curves of Smith the moralist, Samuelson the businessman, and Mun the merchant are the same. Next, we look at the Samuelson&rsquo;s Supply curve to see that it is also business-first:</p>
<div class="squote sam" data-sal="slide-right">
The supply..curve is..the relation between market prices and the amounts of the good that producers are willing to supply. At a higher price of wheat, farmers will take acres out of corn cultivation and put them into wheat. In addition, each farmer can now afford the cost of more fertilizer, labor, machinery.. All this tends to increase output at the higher prices offered. If society wants more wine, then more labor will have to be added to the same limited hill sites for producing grapes.. according to the law of diminishing returns.. the necessary cost to coax out additional product will have to rise.
</div>
<p>Samuelson says that suppliers react to society&rsquo;s high demand for a product (which manifests as higher prices), which then motivates them to produce more of that product. Because of natural limitations, the costs of producing each additional product eventually increase and this leads to higher prices at higher quantities.</p>
<p>In this version, the main cause for the rise in prices with rising quantity is the rising cost of production. Thus, we will call this <strong>the manufacturer&rsquo;s version of the supply curve</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/demsup/eq2.png" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>To Samuelson, the supply curve slopes upward because of rising costs which go up because ofthe law of diminishing returns</figcaption>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="the-mercantile-version">The Mercantile Version</h3>
<p>In <a href="/research/mun/englands-treasure">England&rsquo;s Treasure by Foreign Trade</a>, Mun describes the mercantile supply curve:</p>
<div class="squote mun" data-sal="slide-right">
In our sales overseas, we must think of our neighbours' necessities, so that we can produce as much of the goods they want that are unavailable anywhere else (besides raw materials), and also sell them dear as long as the high price does not reduce our sales.
<cite>Simple England's Treasure, Chapter 3</cite>
</div>
<p>Unlike the manufacturer&rsquo;s supply curve which rises because of rising supply-side production costs, the mercantile supply curve rises because the increased denand-side sales also increases the competition between the merchants for the supply-side wholesale goods.</p>
<div class="squote mun" data-sal="slide-right">
When the Merchant is able to sell his goods overseas, he returns to buy more local goods. This raises the price of our local commodities, and consequently improves the landlords' rents as the leases expire daily. This money, gained by the nation, enables many men to buy lands and make them the dearer.
<cite>Chapter 5</cite>
</div>
<p>While Samuelson&rsquo;s supply curve will lead the producer to want to own all the land, the curve of Mun will lead the merchant to want the collapse of all other merchants. The perfection of the former is done through a war for territory as seen in World War I and II, while that of the latter is done through a trade war, best seen in the War of Jenkin&rsquo;s Ear (Update Sept 2021: and also by Trump&rsquo;s trade war with China).</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/demsup/mun2.png" alt="Mun&rsquo;s curves"></p>
<figcaption>The upward sloping mercantile supply curve is properly stopped by the downward sloping demand curve.</figcaption>
<p>This mercantile supply curve is also seen in modern economics textbooks as the &ldquo;ultra-short run supply curve&rdquo; which is based on profits instead of costs. Samuelson seems to downplay the profit motive in order to emphasize the law of diminishing returns, whereas modern textbooks seem to go straight for profits.</p>
<!-- It explains why Samuelson's farmer switches from corn to wheat in the first place.  -->
<br>
<h3 id="smiths-version">Smith&rsquo;s version</h3>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s supply curve can be seen in Book 1 of The Wealth of Nations, and like Samuelson, is based on cost and not profits.</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
When the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than what is sufficient to pay the rent, wages, and profits employed in raising, preparing, and bringing it to market, according to their natural rates, the commodity is sold its natural price... The natural price is the lowest price that a dealer can sell his goods for any considerable time in the state of perfect liberty, or where he may change his trade as he pleases.
<cite>Wealth Of Nations Book 1, Chapter 7</cite>
</div>
<p><img src="https://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/image002.jpg" alt="Real Downward Supply Curve"></p>
<p>Unlike the producer&rsquo;s or mercantile supply curves which slope upwards, Smith&rsquo;s <a href="/pantrynomics/invisible-hand-of-tao">pantrynomic</a> supply curve slopes downward to represent less effort and energy expense while production increases, in a phenomenon called <strong>economies of scale or division of labour</strong>.</p>
<p>Why does Samuelson&rsquo;s costs go up with more production, while Smith&rsquo;s costs go down, properly leading to lower prices? This is simply because Smith and Samuelson&rsquo;s costs <strong>are seen from different positions</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/lratc.png" alt="Supply Curve Micro Macro"></p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s supply curve is in the left side sloping downwards, representing efficient production, while Samuelson&rsquo;s is the one on the right, representing diseconomies of scale or when the production is being forced beyond its natural rate or limits. All Economics books that discuss the upward sloping supply curve <strong>have no choice but to admit that it is caused by inefficiency</strong>:</p>
<div class="squote" data-sal="slide-right">
Often an individual firm’s ability to respond to an increase in price is constrained by its existing scale of operations, or capacity, in the short run. For example, Brown’s ability to produce more soybeans depends on the size of his farm, the fertility of his soil, and the types of equipment he has. The fact that output stays constant at 45,000 bushels per year suggests thathe is running up against the limitsimposed by the size of his farm, the quality of his soil, and his existing technology.
<cite>Case & Fair, P. 62</cite>
</div>
<p><strong>This admission means that the upward sloping supply curve is unnatural.</strong> If a company is unable to supply the needs of its customers, then other companies can enter and address those needs, relieving the original company of the need to produce unnaturally and inefficiently.</p>
<p>Therefore, the upward sloping curve can only be true if the company had a monopoly and could charge high prices at higher quantities. This means that both the mercantilist and manufacturer&rsquo;s supply curves exist only in a non-free world, or one that follows a survival-of-the-fittest doctrine, which Smith explains simply:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
The price of monopoly is.. the highest.. The natural price, or the price of free competition.. is the lowest..
<cite>Wealth Of Nations Book 1, Chapter 7</cite>
</div>
<p>Thus, we see that the supply curve of modern economics, first established in the 1870&rsquo;s in Europe and then globally through Samuelson, unnoticeably establishes the idea of monopoly, war, and trade war as a natural state.</p>
<p>Update July 2021: This is consistent with history:</p>
<ul>
<li>World War I on July 1914 and II on Septmber 1, 1939</li>
<li>The Cuban Missle Crisis and the Vietnam War in the 1960s</li>
<li>The Latin American debt crisis in the 1970s</li>
<li>The height of the Cold War in the 1980s</li>
<li>The mergers and acquisitions in the 1990s</li>
<li>The Financial Crisis in 2007</li>
<li>The War against the Amazon rainforest in 2019 resulting in Covid</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 id="supply-and-demand">Supply and Demand</h3>
<p>We combine both curves to come up with a Supply and Demand model. Samuelson justifies the unnatural supply curve with buying and selling through an auctioneer scenario. This is the same sophistical technique used by Jevons and Marshall, in their attempt to justify equilibrium.</p>
<br>
<div class="squote sam" data-sal="slide-right">
Which level will the price actually go? And how much will then be produced and consumed?.. Let us proceed what an auctioneer would do, i.e. proceed by trial and error.
</div>
<p>This is obviously false because no one goes to a grocery store to outbid other shoppers for every potato or loaf of bread. Neither do we make bids when we get drinks from a vending machine.</p>
<p>In reality, we as shoppers, have freedom to choose where we do our groceries and which vending machine to get our drinks. It is the groceries and vending machine companies that must compete with other sellers for our attention and choice.</p>
<p>From trial and error, Samuelson ends up with an equilibrium point where both curves intersect:</p>
<br>
<div class="squote sam" data-sal="slide-right">
The equilibrium price, i.e. the only price that can last, is that at which amount willingly supplied and willingly demanded are equal. Competitive equilibrium must be at the intersection point of supply and demand curves.
</div>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/demsup/eq3.png" alt="Samuelson fallacy"></p>
<p>However, it is interesting to note what he says about what happens at low prices:</p>
<div class="squote sam" data-sal="slide-right">
Can that price ($1 per bushel) persist? Again, obviously not-for a comparison of Columns (2) and (3) shows that consumption will exceed production at that price. Storehouses will begin to empty, disappointed demanders who can't get wheat will tend to bid up the too-low price. This upward pressure on P is shown by Column (4)'s rising arrow.
</div>
<p>This is Samuelson&rsquo;s second fallacy because:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product can only be sold cheaply if it is produced cheaply.</li>
<li>It can only be produced cheaply through economies of scale.</li>
<li>If it has economies of scale then there can be no shortage.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, there are many cases of crops being overproduced and merely dumped. If wheat falls to $1, then it means that its production was plentiful, opposite of Samuelson&rsquo;s assertion that storehouses will begin to empty.</p>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/dump.jpg" width="300px">
<figcaption>Crops get a low price when overproduced and are even dumped, opposite of Samuelson's assertion that they will be overconsumed</figcaption>
<br>
<h3 id="the-mercantile-version-1">The Mercantile Version</h3>
<p>Like economist&rsquo;s supply curve, the mercantilist&rsquo;s supply curve also slopes upward.</p>
<div class="squote mun" data-sal="slide-right">
If we send £100,000 in money to Amsterdam to buy Pepper then send it to Italy, it must yield £200,000, doubling the money. If we send the £100,000 to India to buy Pepper and sell it to Italy, we can earn £700,000 gross. But where the voyages are short & the supply plentiful, the profit will be far less. If our consumption of foreign goods stays the same and our exports increased, the overbalance must return as money or foreign goods from our re-exportation, and increase our revenue more.
<cite>Thomas Mun</cite>
</div>
<div class="squote mun" data-sal="slide-right">
[The forex dealer in Amsterdam who imports British coins] has the same effect as if a Dutch Merchant had carried away those coins, which he must do if Dutch goods are overbalanced which makes our money undervalued. And on the contary, when the forex dealer brings in Dutch coins into England, he does the same thing that the English Merchant does when our British commodities overbalance Dutch goods.
<cite>Thomas Mun</cite>
</div>
<!-- <img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/balance.png" width="300px"> -->
<br>
<p>Similarly, the mercantilist advocates reducing supply to increase the selling price, and cutting costs to increase profits.</p>
<p>By replacing &lsquo;exports&rsquo; with &lsquo;sales&rsquo;, and &lsquo;imports&rsquo; with &lsquo;purchases&rsquo; or &lsquo;costs&rsquo;, we can see that the merchant does the same things that the manufacturer does. What the manufacturer calls &lsquo;equilibrium&rsquo; is called &lsquo;balance&rsquo; by the merchant, while &lsquo;profit maximization&rsquo; is &lsquo;overbalance&rsquo; or trade surplus*.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>*The principle of the balance of trade is destroyed by the fact that the US is a net importer but is rich, while China was a net exporter back in the 2000&rsquo;s but was relatively much poorer. If the balance of trade were strictly enforced, then the US should have started a total trade war with China back in the 2000&rsquo;s to avoid being a net importer. <br><br>Similarly, equilibrium is destroyed by the fact that a poor person can buy a $1 anti-parasitic medicine (of low nominal value) which will save his life (have maximum real value). If equilibrium were strictly enforced, then the seller of the $1 medicine should raise its price to $10,000 to be in equilibrium to the future lifetime productive value of the poor man. Alternatively, the seller can auction it to raise its price above $1 and maximize profits. <br><br> All these propositions are absurd.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3 id="smiths-version-1">Smith&rsquo;s Version</h3>
<p>Unlike Samuelson who takes the position of the seller, Smith takes the position of the buyers. This is why profit maximization* never enters Smith&rsquo;s curves.</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
The natural price is the lowest price that a dealer can sell his goods.. The market price is the actual price at which any commodity is commonly sold. Market prices are regulated by the proportion between the quantity to be sold and the demand of buyers willing to pay the natural price.
</div>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
When the commodities fall short of the effectual demand, the shortage will cause some of the buyers give more for those few commodities. This will create a competition among buyers which will raise the market price. When the amount sold exceeds the effectual demand, the excess will remain unsold. To dispose of it, it must be sold to those who are willing to pay less.
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>*Instead of profit maximization as producer&rsquo;s surplus, buyers are interested in bargains as <a href="/articles/pantrynomics/producers-consumers-surplus-deadweight-loss">consumer&rsquo;s surplus</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/demsup/righttao.png" alt="Natural Price Economics"></p>
<p>Unlike the curves of the manufacturer and merchant, Smith&rsquo;s curves slope downwards to create low prices because it views economic activity as ultimately for the demanders or consumers, and not for the suppliers or sellers.</p>
<div class="squote lao" data-sal="slide-right">
It is the Way of Heaven to reduce superabundance and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance.

Who can take his own superabundance and use it to serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao!
<cite>The Simple Tao Te Ching, Part 16</cite>
</div>
<br>
<h3 id="an-inherent-contradiction-leading-to-systemic-crises">An Inherent Contradiction Leading to Systemic Crises</h3>
<p>As you can see in the chart above, the sweet spot of the natural supply and demand is on the lower right section, representing high quantities at low prices.</p>
<p>However, the profit maximization doctrine of Economics teaches that supply must be reduced so that prices will rise. Rather, competition should be stifled in order to preserve one&rsquo;s monopoly position for the sake of guaranteeing high profits for the investors.</p>
<p>The resulting high prices and low supply then contradict the goal of economic growth, especially after bubbles and financial crises. Economists try to save face by saying that perfect competition is needed for it to work. But they do not realize that their supply curve makes perfect competition impossible in the first place. Because of this, &lsquo;real equilibrium&rsquo; is never achieved despite the best efforts of economists and governments.</p>
<!-- Models arise from ideas which then come from feelings. The selfishness in Europe that led to colonization and so many wars also led to the supply curve in Economics and its auctioneer scenario. Both war for territory and the auctioneer scenario are imbued with the spirit of selfishness and monopoly:
- Germany wanted to have the monopoly of Europe
- The auctioneer has a monopoly of the item being sold.  -->
<!-- When you buy bread from a baker, he does not set up an auction for each sale. Instead, you buy the bread at the current market price, which is based on his production cost. 

Auctions most often happen in lands sold off by the government. In such a case, the government must have a monopoly for the sake of effective governance. This monopoly is then broken regularly through democratic elections. -->
<!-- Market equilibrium is unnatural, just as it would be unnatural to enforce the balance of trade between countries. Imagine being denied to import raw materials for your factory for a month just because the country was at a trade deficit at that month! 

Thus, market equilibrium must regularly fail, as seen in crashes, bubbles, and financial crises (which is the failure of financial equlibrium).  -->
<p>Worse is that the ecconomists and policymakers had no idea that their policies and theories were devised by the vested interests of traders, manufacturers, and financiers to benefit traders, manufacturers, and financiers. Such people only want maximum wealth for themselves, not knowing of the problems that excessive wealth creates:</p>
<!-- This manifests as recessions, unemployment, and economic crises, all caused by the fact that the entire system was designed for the benefit of the sellers and not for society. -->

<p>When a potter becomes rich he will not think of you as much as before, grow more and more indolent and careless, and become a worse potter. But, on the other hand, if he has no money, he cannot provide himself with tools or instruments, he will not work well, and he will not teach his sons or apprentices to work well. Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workers can degenerate. Here, then, is a discovery of new evils of wealth and poverty, against which the guardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city unobserved. Wealth is the parent of luxury and indolence. Poverty is the parent of meanness and viciousness. Both are parents of discontent.</p>

<p>Adam Smith specifically pointed to the selfish-interests of traders, manufacturers, and financiers as the origin of the concept of market equilibrium:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
The interest of any dealer is always different from, and even opposite to, the interest of the public. To widen the market and to narrow the competition is always the interest of dealers. To widen the market may frequently be agreeable to the interest of the public. But to narrow the competition must always be against the public interest. It only enables the dealers to levy an absurd tax on the rest of their fellow-citizens, raising their profits unnaturally.<br><br>The proposal of any new commercial law which comes from this order, should always be listened to with great precaution.It should never be adopted until after long and careful examination with the most scrupulous and the most suspicious attention.

<p>The solution is a new paradigm that values all of society:</p>
<ul>
<li>the wage earners: workers, employees</li>
<li>the profit earners: traders, manufacturers, financiers, farmers</li>
<li>the rent earners: government, landlords, intellectual property holders, stockholders, asset owners</li>
<li>the donation earners: religions, researchers, charities, NGOs, news companies, artists</li>
</ul>
<p>By exposing the sophistical ideas such as equilibrium and profit maximization, we can say that Economics from the 1870&rsquo;s is actually a corrupt science, and not merely a dismal one. It descended directly from Mercantilism which caused so much suffering in the colonies in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and is still creating suffering nowadays through inequality, high prices, college debt, high taxes, etc.</p>
<p>Rather than reform a system with a corrupt base, it would be better to take its data and findings, and transplant them onto a new and proper one that is in line with the interests of society and human life.</p>
<p>For this reason, we introduce alternatives to every major economic concept as the foundation of Pantrynomics:</p>
