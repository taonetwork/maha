          <!-- Economics is largely based on Physics as proven by the extensive use of Calculus and the removal of Moral Philosophy during the 19th century. Prior to that, Economics was called the Political Economy which was largely based on law, morals, and not math which can be dismal. Taonomics uses the Effort Theory of Value instead of Marginal Pricing to give value to the Taonomy (an economy that is in the Tao).
linkb: /pantrynomics/the-inelastic-supply-curve-sophistry -->
<p>The invisible hand concept by Adam Smith is one of the most important ideas in our proposed economic science, making up <a href="/pantrynomics/four-laws-of-value">the Second Law of Value</a> which then leads to <a href="/articles/pantrynomics/the-effort-theory-of-value">the effort theory of value</a> which replaces the arbitrary marginal pricing of Neoclassical Economics.</p>
<p>As it is so fundamental, it has to be thoroughly explained. Unfortunately, the invisible hand concept has been corrupted so much by Paul Samuelson in order to advance his own corrupt neoclassical synthesis. Since then, it has been unjustly blamed for bad things about the economy and has even been denounced:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qjvwQrZmpk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Therefore, the first step is to start with a blank slate and separate the original definition from Smith from the popular one from Paul Samuelson:</p>
<div class="squote" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>Smith proclaimed the principle of the ‘invisible hand’. It says that every individual, in selfishly pursuing only his or her personal good, is led, as if by an invisible hand, to achieve the best good for all. In this best of all possible worlds, any interference with free competition is certain to be injurious.</p>
<cite>Economics</cite>
</div>
<br>
<p>Of course, that is absolutely false, since Smith pointed to sympathy and benevolence (the direct opposite of selfishness), as the substance that keeps the machine called society running smoothly. Samuelson merely cherry-picked Smith’s views on self-interest, which to Smith was a &lsquo;praise-worthy&rsquo; positive quality, and then corrupted it into selfishness which is a negative quality:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>Regard to our own private happiness and interest often appear as very laudable principles of action. The habits of oeconomy, industry, discretion, attention, and application of thought, are cultivated from self-interested motives. These habits are seen as very praise-worthy qualities..<br><br>Our instinct for self-preservation instructs us to take proper care of our health, life, or fortune. A person who fails in this would be pitied instead of hated.Carelessness and want of economyare universally disapproved of because it shows a lack of attention to the objects of self-interest and not because of the lack of benevolence.</p>

<figcaption>Being careful does not mean being selfish</figcaption>
<br>
<p>Human creatures should be more careful and attentive (have attention to the self). This does not mean that they should be selfish. The cause of the easy corruption of self-interest into selfishness is the word &lsquo;self&rsquo; that is present in both ideas*. To solve this, we will instead use &lsquo;personal interest&rsquo;, using the Latin word &lsquo;person&rsquo;, meaning mask, instead of the English &lsquo;self&rsquo; which means &lsquo;I&rsquo;. Metaphysically, a mask refers to an indirect ego, different from &lsquo;I&rsquo; which is the direct ego.</p>
<p>To prove this, we cross-reference it with Japanese or Chinese language wherein 私 or 我 has one character while 自分 or 个人 has 2 characters. A word that has fewer characters is a more fundamental or direct expression than one with more characters, just as &lsquo;Sun&rsquo; is more fundamental than &lsquo;Sunday&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thus, Samuelson&rsquo;s invisible hand leads to selfishness, while that of Smith implies personal preferences or choice. If a man orders burgers instead of fries, we never say that he is selfish for burgers. We would only say that he is selfish for burgers if his entire self revolves around burgers as to eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner 365 days in a year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Update Dec 2020: A recent example is the wrong use of the word &lsquo;social distancing&rsquo; to mean a physical separation to avoid virus transmission. This is because &lsquo;society&rsquo; represents an abstract perception. Social distancing would therefore mean being a loner or not minding others even if one is in a jampacked bus or train. The proper term is &lsquo;physical distancing&rsquo;. Mistakes like these can be avoided if Metaphysics or Dialectics were put back as a field of study instead of the rubbish nonsense called Epistemology (which, by following Smith&rsquo;s logic, merely replaced the earlier rubbish nonsense called Ontology. Socrates would call modern epistemologists as pseudo-philosophers who just argue for the sake of having fun from arguments).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-original-invisible-hand">The Original Invisible Hand</h2>
<p>Now that we have flushed Samuelson&rsquo;s invisible hand down the toilet, we can move to the one described by Smith. Its best description is not in The Wealth of Nations, but in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, wherein he describes the <strong>innate human desire for things to work as they were meant to</strong>:</p>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/hand.jpg" width="400px">
<div class="squote smith">
<p>A watch that falls behind more than two minutes in a day, is despised by one curious in watches. He sells it perhaps for two guineas and purchases another at 50 which will not lose more than a minute in a fortnight.. What interests him is not so much the attainment of knowing the time, asthe perfection of the machine created to attain it.</p>
<cite>Simple Theory Of Moral Sentiments, Part 4</cite>
</div>
<br>
<p>Humans have an innate desire for things to work as they were designed. This natural desire applies even to human systems such as resource allocation:</p>
<div class="squote smith">
<p>The proud and unfeeling landlord views his extensive fields, and without a thought for his brethren, he imagines to eat its whole harvest.. The capacity of his stomach is far less than the immensity of his desires and receives no more than that of the meanest peasant. **The rest of the food he is obliged to distribute** among his servants..<br><br>The rich.. divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements despite their natural selfishness and rapacity. They are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of life’s necessities which would have been made, had the earth been divided equally among all its inhabitants.<br><br>Thus, without intending or knowing it, they advance the interest of the society, and afford the means to multiply the species. When Providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor abandoned those who were left out in the partition. These last too enjoy their share of all that it produces. In the **real happiness of human life**, they [the poor] are not inferior to those who seem so much above them. In ease of body and **peace of mind**, all the different ranks of life are nearly on a level. The beggar, who suns himself by the side of the highway, possesses that security which kings are fighting for.</p>

<figcaption>Buddhist monks also beg and sun themselves on the highway yet have the happiness and security that kings are fighting for. Australian moralist Peter Singer thinks that the beggar mentioned by Smith is the dirty type. This makes him think that Smith was promoting poverty and inequality.</figcaption>

<!-- This perfection of the distribution of resources is thus done by **employment**. When a school's basketball team looks for players, it doesn't base its hiring on the players' friendliness, but on their skill. This is true for entrepreneurs hiring workers or outsouring jobs and production to other countries. This focus on skill is more fundamental than the focus on compassion or community: -->
<p>This perfection of the distribution of resources is thus done by employment. Instead of giving scraps and bits of their wealth as wages to employees, the wealthy give most of it through massive employment, naturally leading to full employment.</p>
<p>However, if the wealthy give away most of their wealth to employ anyone and everyone, then the overall wealth of society will decline very fast. To solve this, the natural rule is to employ people based on skill.</p>
<p>When a school’s basketball team looks for players, it doesn’t base its hiring on the players' friendliness, but on their skill. This is true for entrepreneurs hiring workers or outsouring jobs and production to other countries. This focus on skill is more fundamental than the focus on compassion or community:</p>
<div class="squote smith">
<p>When a patriot exerts to improve the public police, his conduct does not always arise from pure sympathy with the happiness of those who will benefit of it. A public-spirited man encourages the mending of high roads not commonly from a fellow-feeling with carriers and wagoner</p>
</div>
<br>
<h3 id="useful-skills--private-personal--public-social-interest">Useful Skills = Private (Personal) + Public (Social) Interest</h3>
<p>Here, Smith clearly states that public benefit or societal productivity does not come from the sympathy for others. Liberals jump into this idea in order to justify selfishness. They disregard the fact that the patriot is <strong>public-spirited in the first place</strong>, which is the opposite of selfishness. Similarly, in our basketball team and entrepreneur example, we don&rsquo;t need to mention that the team is passionate about basketball just as the entrepreneur is passionate about creating goods and services.</p>
<!-- They corrupt Smith by disregarding the non-selfish parts. The purely selfish version of employment and teamwork is called slavery, where the employees and team members are forced into working. -->
<p>Smith likewise explains that the cause that drives public benefit in a free society is the <strong>personal interest or passion</strong> of the person to work on something that both he and the society are BOTH interested in or passionate about. If a society was not interested in Jim&rsquo;s product, then that product would not be sold and there would be no public benefit. Jim&rsquo;s original interest in making that useless product would then not fall under the invisible hand. However, he can still strive to make his product meet the interest of the public by improving it through trial and error. He will only know that it matches the public interest after it actually gets sold.</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>employment (the sale of services) and sales (the sale of goods)</strong> are two of the many ways how the invisible hand taps the energy from personal interest or passion to diffuse its productivity throughout society to quench the needs of the public interest (called effectual demand).</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/dharma.png" alt="Dharma connects to Svadharma"></p>
<p>This mixture of public interest with personal interest usually creates confusion among shallow-thinking humans. People with fellow-feeling (i.e. Socialists) often highlight Smith&rsquo;s emphasis on the public interest. Skilled but selfish people (i.e. Capitalists), on the other hand, highlight his focus on personal interest. From our dialectical analysis, we can see that <strong>personal interest naturally comes first, but is immediately followed by the public interest which is much more important</strong>.</p>
<!-- > *This is easily explained throughthe concept of the mind of society, which is different from the personal mind. -->
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/childmask.jpg" alt="Rescuer helping child to put on mask"></p>
<figcaption>The priority for personal interest is evident among rescuers wherein they must secure themselves before attempting to save others. Their personal interest comes earlier than, but is inferior to, the public interest or the goal of saving others.</figcaption>
<br>
<p>A person can only make good products for others if he is interested in making goods in the first place. A singer can only sing beautifully for others if he likes to sing beforehand. The positive feedback of the market or the audience then encourages the seller or singer to sell or sing more.</p>
<p>Thus, personal interest only has a temporal (time-based) importance, but public interest has a bigger overall (space-based) importance. The variable, time-based nature of the match between personal and public interest manifests as the ups-and-downs of one&rsquo;s career, or of a company&rsquo;s profits, sales, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/dish.jpg" alt="Chef making a dish"></p>
<p>A chef can create a new kind of dish for himself. Other people might try it, like it, and want to buy it. At that point, his personal interest contributes to the public welfare by giving people a new experience that they are also interested in. He then makes more, and other people &lsquo;replicate&rsquo; and &lsquo;mutate&rsquo; his idea as their own products to virally spread the new experience and benefit to all who have the same interest.</p>
<p>This proper and natural mixture of private and public interest then creates a pantrynomy which incorporates all the ideas and maxims from Adam Smith, David Hume, Socrates, and Asian philosophy (we&rsquo;ll explain what Pantrynomy means later). Like an economy, which originated from the management of an estate, it starts with personal interest, incentives, and property protection in order to raise productiviy. But unlike an economy, it switches to the public interest after the productivity has gone beyond the basics and before it gets maxed out. This latter innovation ensures sustainability by preventing inequality and environmental destruction which both go against the Tao.</p>
<p>Inequality is dangerous as it leads to protests, riots, crime, and revolution, the worst of which was the Communist Revolution which killed so many people around the world. Environmental destruction is dangerous too as it leads to storms, droughts, and diseases, the worst of which is the current Covid pandemic which has also killed many.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="human-institutions-unify-personal-and-social-interest">Human Institutions Unify Personal and Social Interest</h3>
<p>The proper policies and laws to bring about the pantrynomy are formalized through human institutions. The most basic institution is called a family. The next institution became the tribe, glued together by blood relations and common interest. These were followed by nations that were glued together by international laws and treaties which put order to the disparate national and vested interests within.</p>
<div class="squote smith">
When a person finds the chairs [disordered in his bedroom], he takes the trouble to set them all in their proper places. The whole propriety of this new situation arises from the superior convenience of having the floor clear. To attain this convenience, he voluntarily puts himself to more trouble than all he could have suffered from its inconvenience. Therefore, he wanted more of the arrangement of things which promotes the convenience, than the convenience itself..<br><br>Those institutions which promote the public welfare are frequently recommended by the same principle, the same love of system, and the same regard to the beauty of order, art, and contrivance.
<cite>Theory Of Moral Sentiments, Part 4, Chapter 1</cite>
</div>
<br>
<p>To Smith, both the cause of the invention of institutions and of clocks are the &lsquo;invisible hand&rsquo; arising from the desire for order and utility. Human effort then works under this desire as the &lsquo;visible hand&rsquo; that actually implements the institutions and builds the clocks. Thus, the invisible hand is a natural organizing principle that manifests as the current order of the universe. Planets don&rsquo;t fly off*, just as babies don&rsquo;t get abandoned after leaving the womb because of this natural principle. But sometimes, planets do act differently (such as Venus that revolves in a different direction) and babies do get abandoned. In such cases, the invisble hand becomes missing in action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Our E = G<sub>l</sub> equation explains this as the &ldquo;G&rdquo; that really does prevent planets and stars from flying off. Knowing the G of everything will then help you prevent their movement, whether it be the movement of stars, people, or the prices of assets and commodities.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="squote smith">
Hence the origin of Polytheism.. which ascribes all the irregular events of nature to.. gods, demons, witches, genies, and fairies. In all Polytheistic religions.. only the irregular events of nature are ascribed to.. their gods. By.. their own nature: fire burns, water refreshes, heavy bodies descend, lighter substances fly upwards. The invisible hand of Jupiter was never perceived in those matters. But the more irregular events were ascribed to Jupiter’s favour or anger: storms and sunshine, thunder and lightning. Savages only knew the designing power of man. 
<cite>Simple Essays, Origin Of Philosophy [emphasis Added]</cite>
</div>
<br>
<p>For this organizing principle to be universal, it must have been perceived also by other cultures. Only then can it be a viable foundation for our natural invisible hand and effort theory of value which will replace chance-based marginal pricing. Fortunately, Asian philosophy has the concept of dharma.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="dharma-as-the-natural-organizing-principle">Dharma as the Natural Organizing Principle</h2>
<p>Dharma in Hinduism and Buddhism is the inherent nature of things, as designed by its maker. A baker that bakes a cake designs it as a cake and expects it to be a cake in the end, even if it starts as flour. If it turns out to be a pie or a large biscuit, then it does not match its design or plan. It is called a bad or awful cake and is &lsquo;adharmic&rsquo;. If it turns out as a cake as designed, then it is good or &lsquo;dharmic&rsquo;*.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Dharma and Smith&rsquo;s invisible hand are supposed to come from Brahma and Providence (God) respectively. However, the idea of a superior God seems to drive away materialists and egotistic people who have been liberalized to view themselves as their own god and master of their own destiny. In fact, of the current populations, only the Muslims seem to be the group that is amenable to having their will subservient to a divine being such as the concept of Allah.<br>
As such, our definition of dharma mutes any references to God or any divine being so that it can get a chance at mass adoption even by those materialists and egotistic people who are at the forefront of destroying rainforests for big money and driving inequality through slave-wages and speculative investments that raise asset prices. Only by giving them a positive reason to switch sides, while keeping their selfishness and ego, can there be hope for sustainability in the face of the global warming disasters and inequality that Economics, and the blind focus on economic growth, has created. As they say, desperate times call for desperate measures.<br>
Note that this only mutes God and does not cancel It. The unmuting can be done scientifically through the development of artificial intelligence which will reveal God to be a Matrix, and our existence to be a virtual reality inside the mind of Brahma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dharma of a pantrynomy is to keep on producing utility for society. This is why the selfish landlord gave up part of his crops to be given as wages to his employees so that they could maintain his agricultural system. Had he kept all of his crops for himself, there would be no one to grow the next batch and his estate&rsquo;s economic system would fail and become adharmic. Thus, the personal interests of the landlord and his employees work together naturally to create a bigger public benefit. Like the public spirited man in the earlier example, they worked on the fields for the love of agriculture and not for society. And it is by this focus (not selfishness) that they were able to improve their skills and increase their productivity for the benefit of everyone in the pantrynomy.</p>
<div class="squote smith">
<p>Every individual necessarily works to render the society’s annual revenue as great as he can. He generally does not intend to promote the public interest, or know how much he is promoting it. By preferring to support domestic industry over foreign industry, he intends only his own security.By directing that industry to produce the greatest value [for society], he intends only his own gain. In this case, as in many other cases,he is led by an invisible hand to promote an end which he did not intend.Nor is it always the worse for the society that it [the society] was no part of it [the goal]. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes the society’s interest more effectively than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation not very common among merchants. Very few words can be used to dissuade them from it.</p>

<br>
<h3 id="enter-socrates">Enter Socrates</h3>
<p>This focus leads to specialization or division of labor within an overall team or social effort. Unknown to many, it was Socrates, and not Smith, who first emphasized the importance of knowing one&rsquo;s personal interest in relation to the common interest, as to create the division of labor:</p>
<div class="squote socrates">
The division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and not another's, was a shadow of justice. But in reality, justice was concerned not with the outward man, but with the inward or the true self.<br><br>The just man does not permit the several elements within him to interfere with one another, or any of them to do the work of others. He sets his own inner life in order, and he masters himself with his own law, to be at peace with himself. A man whose occupation is opposite of his interest has a sort of lameness. 
<cite>Socrates,the Simple Republic By Plato, Book 4, Chapter 2</cite>
</div>
<p>Like Smith, Socrates* asserts that the common interest is promoted by personal interest through trade and employment. He also shows that such a personal interest leads to personal peace, exactly the kind that kings are fighting for, as described by Smith. Socrates, however, adds a missing ingredient to achieving such a peace, by explaining that **a person&rsquo;s focus on his personal interest will help him to discover his true self**, which is then the key to lasting peace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*The topic of the book The Republic is justice which Socrates defined to be human dharma, just as his concept of specialization is svadharma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can even extend his idea onto Sociology in order to end wars between nations. For example, each country can define its own true nature, and then let others accept their definition and create treaties based on it*. This is different from the current political system where a powerful country like the US pushes its own ego and nature onto weaker countries like Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, totally disregarding their nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*This are called Constitutional Virtues. Update August 2021: <a href="/analysis/social-cycles/how-to-fix-afghanistan">The mistake of the US policy in Afghanistan</a> was in imposing civilized Western democracy in a barbarous country. This is a contradiction of natures and explains the failure of the policy despite 20 years of hard work in establishing it.</p>

<p>For this true nature to be a viable foundation for a socio-political science and system*, it must have been likewise advocated by other cultures. Luckily again, we find that Hinduism has such a concept as svadharma and Taoism has the concept of the Tao.</p>
<!-- While the socio-economic aspects of the invisible hand form the core of Taonomics, its socio-political aspects form the core of Supersociology. Both are subsets of our proposedSocial Superphysics.

<p>Svadharma means self-dharma or the inherent nature of the self. It means one&rsquo;s own path, nature, or destiny and is described in the Bhagavad Gita:</p>
<div class="squote">
It is far better to perform one’s natural prescribed duty, though tinged with faults, than to perform another’s prescribed duty, though perfectly. In fact, it is preferable to die in the discharge of one’s duty, than to follow the path of another, which is fraught with danger. 
<cite>Chapter 3, Verse 35</cite>
</div>
<p>Nowadays, this is known as &lsquo;keeping it real&rsquo; or &lsquo;being true to oneself&rsquo;, which is similar to the Tao, which is one&rsquo;s own, natural way:</p>
<!-- For example, the local manufacturer follows the dharma of local manufacturing in order to create excellent goods for local consumption, not expecting it to be exported. He finds them getting exported anyway and even going viral overseas because of its superior quality and fit for purpose. This is  -->
<div class="squote">
Knowing others is intelligence;
knowing yourself is true wisdom.
Mastering others is strength;
mastering yourself is true power.
<cite>Tao Te Ching Verse 33</cite>
</div>
<p>Human dharma would imply knowing and mastering others, while svadharma would be knowing and mastering oneself. A manufacturer who knows his core competencies will be a better manufacturer who is a jack of all trades and a master of none. An army squad made up of specialists will perform their missions better than one made up of general infantry.</p>
<p>To Socrates, this respect for everyone&rsquo;s personal interest is the foundation of justice and therefore the basis for society. A society collapses when its members do not respect each others' existential interests.</p>
<!-- Like human dharma, svadharma works unconsciously in humans and is not based on compassion or fellow-feeling, just as typhoons do not operate on the wind's affections for the land. Svadharma's purpose is to secure, propagate, and add meaning to life, giving everyone ease of body and peace of mind in their own way. A typhoon's svadharma is to release the energy that it has accumulated, in order to balance it out and return the peace. -->

<p>Smith wrote that governments must understand the invisible hand of svadharma in order to create proper policies and avoid disorder:</p>
<div class="squote smith">
The man of system is.. often so enamoured with.. his own ideal plan of government.. He imagines that he can arrange the members of a great society with as much ease asthe hand arranges the different pieces on a chess-board.
He does not consider that the pieces.. have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them.But that, in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might choose to impress on it.
If those two principles.. act in the same direction, the game of human society will go on easily and harmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful. If they are opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder.

<p>The best laws are those that match the collective svadharma of their society and not just the personal interests of a few people. Thus, the invisble hand is never an external imposition, but rather <a href="/articles/pantrynomics/the-eagle">an internal principle of movement</a> &ndash; the same principles that make a fire burn or the wind blow. The West eventually discovered the way to find this internal principle through suffrage or by asking everyone to express who should be their nation&rsquo;s leader.</p>
<p>Nowadays, surveys and school exams are the most common ways to discover the interests of each person, and this is why education is very important. Asking a child what he wants to become is another common way, but even this is often not emphasized in some cultures.</p>
<p>From here, we can now define our pantrynomy as a system of resource allocation that is in line with the Tao or Dharma. The definition of the Tao or Dharma then depends on the kind of discrete entity described, whether it be a family, company, nation, or planet.</p>
<p>We can now see how different the invisible hand described by Smith is from the one described by Samuelson. The proper invisible hand hand has public and personal aspects working together according to the designer of Nature:</p>
<div class="squote smith">
Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his own advantage which he has in view [svadharma], and not that of the society. But the study of his own advantage naturally leads him to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to society [human dharma].
That wisdom which contrived the system of human affections and that of every other part of nature, seems to have judged that the interest of the great society of mankind [human dharma] would be best promoted by directing the principal attention of each individual to what was most within the sphere of his abilities and understanding [svadharma].
<cite>Simple Theory of Moral Sentiments, Part 6, Chapter 2</cite>
<br>
Every individual can, in his local situation [svadharma], judge much better than any statesman on what domestic industry his capital produce the greatest value. The statesman who directs private people how they should employ their capitals would load himself with a most unnecessary attention.
<cite>Book 4, Chapter 2</cite>

<h2 id="the-invisible-hand-in-a-nutshell">The Invisible Hand in a Nutshell</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Absolute Entity (Nirguna Brahma) was lonely</li>
<li>To be un-lonely, It split Itself into infinite (arbitrary) selves and things to experience Its selves and things</li>
<li>These selves and things have their own nature which represents a piece of the Nature of It</li>
<li>This True Nature, as called by Socrates, is called Tao or Dharma in Asia, while &lsquo;own nature&rsquo; is called svadharma</li>
<li>The Invisible Hand is Its way of maintaining Its Nature and own natures for Its own purposes</li>
<li>These maintaining processes manifest as natural systems such as gravitation, thermodynamics, symbiosis, societies, agriculture, governance, supply and demand via exchange, etc</li>
<li>Such processes can be made artificial through human intervention such as clockmaking, industrialization, reforestation, election systems, monetary systems, etc.</li>
<li>Some human interventions might actually go against the Dharma, such as pollution, speculation, nuclear weapons, deforestation, election-rigging, tax evasion, etc.  These destroy instead of maintain.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2 id="examples-of-the-invisible-hand-in-action">Examples of the Invisible Hand in Action</h2>
<p>While Samuelson applies the invisible hand shallowly to justify deregulation and personal selfishness, Smith&rsquo;s invisible hand is applicable to so many non-business and non-selfish aspects of human life:</p>
<ul>
<li>A student who follows his true passion of studying a course that his parents might not like, and then being more useful to society despite having less revenue (such as being a nurse instead of a lawyer)</li>
<li>A software developer who is confident with his skills so he becomes a freelancer or sets up his own software consultancy and gets more revenue instead of working for someone else</li>
<li>An army captain taking the initiative to save his men from the enemy fire instead of waiting for orders from headquarters, and then getting a medal for it without expecting it (since a medal is worthless to a dead soldier)</li>
<li>People protesting a law that might be beneficial to a small sector, but harmful to the rest of society</li>
<li>A citizen cleaning up the mess in his neighborhood himself, instead of waiting for the local government to do it</li>
<li>A country taking time to understand the interest of another country when making a new trade deal</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, we can now expand the scope of the invisible hand beyond business and trade, and into politics, education, organizations, society, and even onto physics and healthcare. This makes it a fundamental principle similar to the principles of karma and shiva-shakti that permeates the whole of our proposed Superphysics (Material, Medical, and Social).</p>
<p>Smith gave other types of invisible hand in The Theory of Moral Sentiments that mirror the observations made by Hindus, which we can simplify as follows:</p>

<figcaption>The dharmas mentioned in The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations</figcaption>
<br>
<p>The next post will show how the invisible hand manifests as the Second law of Value in the Four laws of Pantrynomics.</p>
<!-- In our future posts, we shall compare these different invisible hands to show how physical and human dharma oppose each other morally. We will also show how ashrama and varna dharmas were used by ancient China and India to become sustainably prosperous by maximizing labor productivity and quality, leading to great, prosperous empires without any "profit maximization function" or any of the sophistical "supply or demand curves" advocated by the West. -->
