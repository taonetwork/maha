      <description>-- Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in the middle of August, three months after the US announced a complete withdrawal of its troops. The fall surprised a lot of people especially since the US spent 20 years building the country from scratch. It was the job of the Afghan army to defend their country and they were doing a decent job before 2021, despite the corruption of their leaders.
This all changed when Trump announced a withdrawal of the US military by May 1, 2021, a policy which was continued by Biden.</description>

 Country Prediction Outcome     World 2015: A global crisis will begin in 2019 as a long crisis Correct   World 2019: A global financial crisis will emerge in a certain year between 2020-2030 as a result of that 2019 crisis Pending    2021: Probing prediction--Kono will be Prime Minister.</description>

      <title>How to fix Japan: Why Abenomics and Keynesian Economics Failed</title>

      <description>Japan has been suffering from chronic deflation since 1991 after the bursting of their asset price bubble. This is similar in pattern to the secular stagnation in the US after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Both problems persist because they have been given the wrong solutions in the form of &amp;ldquo;quantitative easing&amp;rdquo; (QE) in the US, and &amp;ldquo;Abenomics&amp;rdquo; in Japan.
What is Abenomics? Abenomics is a set of economic policies organized into three arrows:</description>

      <title>How to Fix Greece</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/analysis/social-cycles/how-to-fix-greece/</link>

      <description>-- We can use our DCTI tool to analyze the Greek crisis to prove that the current solutions of austerity and high taxes are not the best ones. Such solutions are are a relic of the mercantile way of thinking of an economy as a business, instead of, naturally, as a society, family, or group of friends. The proper solution will involve the whole EU and will help the union stay together*.</description>

      <description>The DCTI tool can diagnose the economic health of societies according the maxims of Adam Smith.
A society, whether it be a family, corporation, or country, is wealthy if its productivity or value produced exceeds its own demand or value needed. This productivity is shown in the “Industry” column below, while the demand is shown in the “Demand” column. A society is wealthy if its Industry bars are higher than its Demand bars and poor if it is lower.</description>
