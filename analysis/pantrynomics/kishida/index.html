<h2 id="2-revival-of-dynamism-of-japanese-companies-startup-a-leader-in-innovation">2. Revival of dynamism of Japanese companies, Startup, a leader in innovation</h2>
<p>(1) Promotion of commercialization and service of elemental technologies
In Japan, even if we succeed in research and development of elemental technologies, products and services will not be successful.
However, there are some cases where companies in other countries have monetized their businesses.
New technologies are possible for Japanese companies to promote the commercialization and service of elemental technologies
Strengthening the &ldquo;connoisseur power&rdquo; of management that finds sexuality and the &ldquo;business start-up power&rdquo; that leads to commercialization
The management power of the people, such as the development of human resources with such power and the integrated promotion of management strategy and intellectual property strategy
It is necessary to proceed with the strengthening of.
(2) Promotion of creation of new products and services with high added value
According to the OECD, the percentage of companies that have introduced new products and services is manufacturing in Japan.
Only 9.9% in the industry and 4.9% in the service industry, Germany (18.8% in the manufacturing industry, 9.0% in the service industry) and
It is lower than the United States (manufacturing industry 12.7%, service industry 7.6%).
In addition, Japan&rsquo;s labor productivity (GDP per worker) will be $ 75,000 in 2019.
The lowest among the G7 countries.
Looking at the markup rate, which shows how many times the manufacturing cost is sold,
The number of books is only 1.3 times, which is lower than that of the United States of 1.8 times and the United Kingdom of 1.7 times.
In this way, Japanese companies do not create new products or services, and secure sufficient selling prices.
I haven&rsquo;t come. Raising the selling price is not a problem of on-site workers or employees, but a management problem
Is.
Japanese companies can create high value-added products and services and secure high selling prices.
5 By creating added value, employees and others are in line with the new idea of ​​capitalism.
It is necessary to transform Japanese industry into a structure that distributes added value to business partners.
To this end, Japanese companies can break away from the traditional &ldquo;selling of goods&rdquo; and aim for high profits.
Promote sales of &ldquo;services&rdquo;, utilize AI / big data, and strengthen brand power
It is necessary to promote reform of the business structure such as.
In addition, new products and new products that utilize cutting-edge technology to overcome challenges unique to emerging countries
Reverse innovation is accelerating as services are created and imported back into developed countries
NS. In Japan as well, companies in emerging Asian countries and Japanese companies collaborate to quickly succeed as a model.
And promote efforts to promote reimportation to Japan.
(3) Creating an environment that creates startups and expands the scale
For a successful growth strategy, start-ups that are the leaders of innovation
It is necessary to provide thorough support and promote the creation of new businesses and industries.
The number of startups in Japan has been increasing in recent years, but companies with a corporate age of 0 to 2 years
Only 13.9% of the total enterprises, the United States (20.5%), the United Kingdom (22.4%), and F.
Low compared to Lance (22.8%).
In addition, listed companies in Japan were established in 1945-1954, such as Sony and Honda Motor Co., Ltd.
The largest number of companies is 119, while the listed companies in the United States are Amazon and Facebook.
The number of companies established in 1995-2004 is the largest at 124.
Furthermore, there are few startups that grow in Japan, and unicorns (market capitalization 1 billion)
As of March 1, 2021, there are 274 companies in the United States, 123 companies in China, and 67 companies in Europe.
While it is a company, there are only four companies in Japan.
In this way, in Japan, the number of startups that are the leaders of innovation is
It remains at a low level and very few startups are growing.
In order to build the future of Japan, it is necessary to create a second entrepreneurial boom that continues immediately after the end of the war.
Therefore, it is necessary to work on creating an environment for the creation and growth of startups.
For example, in Japan, the scale of VC / CVC investment and angel investment is larger than that of the United States.
Very small. Also, in the United States, it&rsquo;s not the current profits of startups, but the future
While a large amount of investment is gathered in anticipation of longevity, in Japan it is possible to make short-term profits
It is difficult for startups to make growth investments because of the demand.
Creating a social environment that encourages challenges toward the creation and growth of startups,
Mobilization of human resources by promoting side jobs and side jobs, start by steady operation of new SBIR system
Government procurement from UP, policy financing for startups to increase employment,
Development of a new listing environment by examining the SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) system, large companies and stars
Comprehensively promote the optimization of business relationships with Toup.</p>
<p>(4) Examination of initial public offering (IPO) process and SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) system</p>
<p>The listing system in Japan is kind to entrepreneurs who are trying to take on new challenges. It cannot be said that it is a good system. In Japan&rsquo;s listing system, securities companies, not startups</p>
<p>The structure is such that the customers of the company are profitable, and the startup does not have enough funds.</p>
<p>Specifically, for initial public offerings (IPOs), entrepreneurs sell their shares compared to other countries.</p>
<p>The stock price (initial price) established in the market on the first day of listing greatly exceeds the price (public price), and the company starts a business.
The amount of money raised for the house is small.</p>
<p>Based on this situation, the Fair Trade Commission will discuss the public pricing process at the time of IPO.</p>
<p>Promote understanding of the actual situation at the meeting. Also, at the Japan Securities Dealers Association,
How to set open prices to reflect actual demand and more so as to contribute to sustainable growth</p>
<p>This year, we are studying how to allocate shares in line with the intentions of startups.
Make an intermediate compilation with the aim of the inside.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the SPAC system introduced in other countries, it will be a startup at the time of acquisition.</p>
<p>Investors agree and decide the price, so it is possible to list at a price that is mutually convincing</p>
<p>Yes, while it seems to be meaningful in solving the current listing problem, investor insurance</p>
<p>For this reason, the Tokyo Stock Exchange opposes listing standards, disclosure methods, and acquisitions.
Investor protection measures such as return of funds to general investors, disclosure of acquired companies, etc.</p>
<p>Regarding the system development required when SPAC is introduced from the perspective of, taking into account the situation in other countries,
After concretely examining and arranging the points of discussion, a conclusion is reached.</p>
<p>(5) Support for open innovation with large companies</p>
<p>Start up on tax measures to promote open innovation with large companies
Scope of target shares so that efforts to deepen cooperation through the acquisition of shares of companies will increase
We will consider the expansion of the tax system and reach a conclusion in the tax reform next year at the end of this year.
In addition, we will support the matching of human resources between large companies and start-ups.</p>
<p>(6) Strengthening competition policy to promote fair competition</p>
<p>In order to promote new capitalism, local small and medium-sized enterprises, subcontractors, and studios
It is important to create a rich middle class, including to-ups. In the West
Actively advocating (advocacy; recommendations) from competition authorities to other government agencies, etc.
The development of a fair competitive environment is steadily progressing. Even in Japan, highly specialized outsiders
Digital market such as optimization of transactions of start-ups and SMEs and communication while utilizing materials
Fair trade, including infrastructure fields such as energy markets such as fields and electric power
Strengthen the effectiveness of the committee&rsquo;s advocacy function.
In addition to qualitative enhancement such as improvement of specialized knowledge, quantitative expansion such as drastic expansion of organization and personnel
The system of the Fair Trade Commission will be strengthened in a focused and systematic manner by making various efforts.</p>
<p>(7) Promotion of transparency and fairness in the digital advertising market</p>
<p>The market is oligopolistic with respect to digital advertising, which is an important infrastructure that supports the digital market.
One-sided rule changes by platform operators and the number of advertisement views
Various issues have been pointed out, such as false billing of advertising expenses due to padding. This situation
Based on this, the digital advertising market has been added to the scope of the Digital Platform Transaction Transparency Law.
However, for large-scale platform operators, the content and reason when changing the rules
Disclosure before, request thorough explanation about the risk of fraudulent acquisition of advertising expenses, etc.
Develop a system for transparency and fairness.</p>
