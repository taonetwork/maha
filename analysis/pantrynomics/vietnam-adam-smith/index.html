          <p>During the cold war, two flavors of Communism arose:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Soviet Stalin flavor</li>
<li>The Chinese Mao flavor</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of the Soviet Union, the Stalin flavor was implemented in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cuba</li>
<li>Vietnam</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of China, the Mao flavor was implemented in:</p>
<ul>
<li>North Korea</li>
<li>Cambodia</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mao flavor was totally replaced in 1980 with the Deng flavor. The Stalin flavor died in 1991, to be replaced with the Putin flavor in Russia.</p>
<p>The Deng flavor stopped being Communism and instead became single-party state capitalism. The Putin flavor likewise stopped being Communism and turned into a classic one-man dictatorship. In Vietnam, this manifests as a one-party dictatorship.</p>
<p>The difference in the two new flavors is evident in the difference between China and Vietnam.</p>
<h3 id="chinas-success">China&rsquo;s Success</h3>
<p>The success of China&rsquo;s state-capitalism is its accession into the World Trade Organization thanks to Bill Clinton. This gave it access to the global market which could be satisfied by its huge workforce. We can say that Clinton accomplished for China what the Ming emperor failed to achieve when its cargo ships (treasure fleet) was burnt:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">In a country fully peopled.. the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers.. China seems to have been long stationary, and had probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions. But this complement may be much inferior to what, with other laws and institutions, the nature of its soil, climate, and situation might admit of." 
<cite>The Simple Wealth of Nations, Book 1, Chapter 9</cite>

<br>
<br>
<h3 id="vietnams-hits-and-misses">Vietnam&rsquo;s Hits and Misses</h3>
<p>Vietnam on the other hand, is not as successful because it has some policies going against the proper economic development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tradition and culture follows Confucianism and Asian culture which are not liberal at all. This reduces productivity immensely. For example, women are expected to stay at home or are given lower roles and salaries, limiting their contribution to the economy. There is a lot of emphasis on social traditions (Tet, taking care of children directly) that also limit productivity.</li>
<li>The educational system is quite backward relative to industrialized countries. There is no freedom to explore new ideas, which then limits innovation. It seems nationalism is emphasized at the expense of basic skills like foreign language and critical thinking and virtues such as being on time, finishing work diligently, being honest, etc.</li>
<li>Moral philosophy is Communist / Marxst / Leninist. Because of weak moral philosophy (e.g. dialectical materialism), corruption is rampant.</li>
<li>English is not supported because it is seen as anti-nationalistic. China, on the other hand, does not have this problem because Mandarin is a global language</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/hero/farmerrice.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>However, Vietnam has good policies that prevent it from becoming a Cuba or North Korea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Land is distributed to farmers instead of being amassed by landlords or the government. Golf courses and private villages are still not so common, allowing land to be used more productively. Like Singapore, all land belongs to the state, and it is just ‘leased’ to the people. This gives the state control over its own land.</li>
<li>Telecoms and utilities such as VNPT and EVN are state owned. This lowers the cost of energy and communication which is the backbone of industry, unlike in the countries where utilities are privately owned for profits.</li>
<li>The state is able to avoid liberalizing the banking industry and is therefore able to keep its currency better under control.</li>
</ul>

<!-- However, it has more policies that are contrary to those of Smith which render it non-wealthy:
