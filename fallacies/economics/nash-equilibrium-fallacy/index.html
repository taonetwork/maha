          <p>The Nash equilibrium, also known as the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma, comes from Game Theory which is inherently a Mercantile/Commercial idea: Merchant A competes with Merchant B to get points called money. According to Adam Smith, Thomas Mun is the father of this mercantile idea. Mun writes:</p>
<div class="squote hume" data-sal="slide-right">
But other nations might sell the same goods as we do. This might reduce the demand for our goods. In this case, we must sell as cheap as possible, rather than lose the sale. By lowering the price of our cloth in Turkey, we have sold more. The Venetians have lost because theirs is dearer. When our cloth was expensive, we lost at the least half our clothing to foreigners.
<cite>England's Treasure on Foreign Trade, Chapter 3</cite>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="a-price-war-is-a-race-to-the-bottom">A Price War is a Race to the Bottom</h2>
<!--  Better with State Support -->
<p>A price war is the best way for merchants to undersell each other and gain market share. However, this method lowers the profits of them all. This is why merchants must lobby of subsidies for the state to absorb the merchants' losses, or raise tariffs to block out the foreign competition. These raise prices and violate Adam Smith&rsquo;s maxims on free trade and free competition. In order to justify protectionism, merchants cite the benefits of the surplus in the balance of trade, wherein exports of Country A should be larger than the exports of other countries.</p>
<div class="squote" data-sal="slide-right">
We must gain in every exchange and bring in treasure into our nation. This gain can only be done by the overbalance of our trade. This overbalance is reduced by restrictions. Therefore, such restrictions hinder the increase of our wealth.
<cite>England's Treasure on Foreign Trade, Chapter 11</cite>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The competitive nature of the mercantile system leads to trade being a game, which then led to the creation of Game Theory. The two rival merchants become prisoners who must bet against each other.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/nash.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Smith, on the contrary, did not view trade as a competition, but as a cooperation between buyers and sellers:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
Two persons trade undoubtedly for the advantage of both. Person A has more commodities than he needs, so he exchanges some of it for the useful commodity of Person B who agrees to the bargain on the same account. In this way, the mutual commerce is advantageous to both.
<cite>Simple Lectures on Jurisprudence</cite>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<!-- This competitive game has its roots in the marginal revolution which later became a fundamental but erroneous belief in Economics because it causes Country A to ‘fight’ Country B leading to war, such as War of Jenkin’s ear which started as a commercial dispute. Smith wrote against the ‘balance of trade’ doctrine which caused that war. Unfortunately, no one understood him and the balance of trade evolved to become ‘equilibrium’ in equilibrium theory: -->
<p>He would therefore bash Game theory and the Equilibrium theory where it came from:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all the other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places trade with one another, this doctrine supposes that, if the balance be even, neither of them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side, that one of them loses and the other gains in proportion to its declension from the exact equilibrium. Both suppositions are false. 
<cite>Wealth of Nations, Book 4</cite>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<!-- To Smith, resource allocation is not a competitive game. Instead, it is a system of working together through the division of labour in the great machine called society. The baker bakes, the brewer brews better than the baker brewing and the brewer baking.  -->
<p>To Smith, Brewer A competes with Brewer B to provide the best beer or cheapest beer (or whatever beer desired) to society. Unlike in Game Theory where each player anticipates the other’s move, Brewer A’s decisions are naturally based on the market and not on Brewer B. The brewers will decide based on feedback from customers. We never see any store owner plot matrices to plan the probability of their competitors’ actions.</p>
<p>Thus, Smith&rsquo;s natural price theory and the Nash equilibrium are opposed to each other.</p>
