      <title>The Different Notions of Interest Rates</title>

      <description>The failure of quantitative easing, both in the US under Obama and in Japan as Abenomics, is proof that the operations of banking cannot directly and immediately lead to economic growth, as explained by Adam Smith:
The judicious operations of banking can increase a country’s industry, not by augmenting the country’s capital, but by rendering most of that capital productive. The Simple Wealth of Nations Book 2, Chapter 2  This is opposite the notion of Keynes that interest rates, set by banks, are the key to growing an economy:</description>

      <title>The Inelastic Supply Curve Sophistry</title>

      <description>The inelastic supply curve is the child-idea of the sophistry called the Equilibrium Theory of Economics. It manifests as a vertical line that says* that an essential, but hard-to-produce product can command whatever price its supplier wants.
 *Samuelson refers to it as the inelastic supply curve, while Case and Fair, and Roger Miller refer to it as the inelastic demand curve
 If the amount supplied is perfectly fixed, as in perishable fish for sale at whatever price, we face the perfectly inelastic supply.</description>

      <title>The Resource Based Economy</title>

      <description>Another flawed economic paradigm, aside from the Steady State Economy is the Resource Based Economy (RBE) by Jacque Fresco. It is implemented as The Venus Project which is a tech-urban master plan. This is a necessary consequence of Mr. Fresco being a designer by trade, as opposed to being a practicing scientist or civil engineer.
  Its most striking feature is that it aims to distribute goods and services without using:</description>

      <title>The Circular Flow of Economics and Business vs Pantrynomics and the Taonomy</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/fallacies/economics/the-circular-flow-of-economics/</link>

      <description>To maximize profits, business systems pool money together into the equity that makes up firms and corporations that create, buy, and sell real goods and services in society via secondary arbitrage. In time, these become very good at accumulating capital and starving others of it, causing a recession or crisis. Notice how &amp;lsquo;businesses&amp;rsquo; is a huge entity in the Circular Flow of Economics below. To prevent inequality in Economics, commercial taxation is done.</description>

      <title>Law of Supply and Demand Fallacy</title>

      <description>*Update April 2021: The actual supply prices of Covid vaccines are consistent with our assertions here that the supply curve cannot be naturally vertical, and is the final proof of the sophistry of the equilibrium theory of Economics
 Adam Smith’s Supply and Demand Curves (below) are the foundation our proposed science called pantrynomics which is based on Classical Economics. It can be applied to any problem in economics in order to provide common sense answers.</description>

      <title>Ricardo&#39;s Labor Theory of Value</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/fallacies/economics/ricardo-labor-theory-of-value/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.one/fallacies/economics/ricardo-labor-theory-of-value/</guid>
      <description>Ricardo&amp;rsquo;s criticism of Smith&amp;rsquo;s wheat-based valuation comes from the fact that he never understood it in the first place. His Labor Theory of Value is based on money-wages and Smith&amp;rsquo;s which is based on grains. Below is a portion of this chapter on value: Adam Smith said that the value of all things was relative to the amount of labour bestowed on their production. He sometimes used wheat, sometimes labour, as a standard measure.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium vs Smith&#39;s Natural Prices</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/fallacies/economics/nash-equilibrium-fallacy/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.one/fallacies/economics/nash-equilibrium-fallacy/</guid>
      <description>The Nash equilibrium, also known as the Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma, comes from Game Theory which is inherently a Mercantile/Commercial idea: Merchant A competes with Merchant B to get points called money. According to Adam Smith, Thomas Mun is the father of this mercantile idea. Mun writes:
But other nations might sell the same goods as we do. This might reduce the demand for our goods. In this case, we must sell as cheap as possible, rather than lose the sale.</description>

      <title>Profit Maximization is Absurd</title>

      <guid>https://superphysics.one/fallacies/economics/profit-maximization-is-absurd/</guid>
      <description>A key fallacy that is inseparably part of Economics, along with equilibrium, is the idea of profit maximization.
The idea of maximization has its origins in Newton&amp;rsquo;s Calculus which in turn has its origins in Physics. Smith and Hume never mentioned maximization nor calculus anywhere in their writings on the political economy. In fact, The Wealth of Nations has no equations at all*!
 *Instead of equality, equilibrium, equations, or 1 + 1 = 2, Smith makes extensive use of ratios, proportions, balance, or 2 : 2, as prices are psychological and not physical in nature.</description>

      <title>Simple Say&#39;s Law</title>

      <description>To prove the sophistry of capitalism, we must trace the roots of its core ideas. Among its core ideas is the production motive, or the sophistical belief that what is good for the producers or sellers, or those who live by profits, is good for the nation. This is in contrast to the consumption motive espoused by Adam Smith.
The production motive is best seen in Say&amp;rsquo;s Law which says that production is the cause of demand.</description>

      <title>Karl Marx vs Adam Smith</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/fallacies/economics/karl-marx-vs-adam-smith/</link>

      <description>I came upon a video explaining the Marxist view of use value and exchangeable value. It was easy to see the difference between the values of Marx and those of Smith.
   Idea Marx Smith     Use Value Usefulness of an object Usefulness of an object to a person   Exchangeable Value Purely relative, intrinsic value of an object &#34;(value) expressed in terms of something common to (all commodities)&#34;</description>

      <title>The Iron Law of Wages of David Ricardo</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/fallacies/economics/iron-law-of-wages/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.one/fallacies/economics/iron-law-of-wages/</guid>
      <description>Adam Smith said that the differences in wages are due to five factors (agreeableness, trust, constancy, risk, cost of learning) and 3 states (backward, stationary, advancing).
In contrast, David Ricardo simplistically said that wages are based on the supply and demand of workers and the cost of goods and services which wages are spent on. Because of this simplicity, Ricardo concluded that wages must fall (Iron Law of Wages). This is similar to that or Marx, who was also very simplistic.</description>

      <title>The Fallacy of the Steady State Economy</title>

      <description>The current increase in global warming and overpopulation is leading to more natural disasters on top of the depletion of resources. This causes people to look for alternative resource systems that are more sustainable. This in turn puts more non-mainstream economic proposals, both good and bad, to the public view. In this post, we shall discuss a bad proposal called the Steady State Economy.
What is the Steady State Economy? Its founder Herman Daly defines it as:</description>
