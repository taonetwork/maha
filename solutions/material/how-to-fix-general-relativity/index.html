          <p>While collating the works of Socrates in order to unify them with the works of David Hume and harmonize Superphysics, I came upon his maxims on astrophysics that referred to the proper way to judge the movement of heavenly bodies:</p>
<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge. Any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship. But he would never think that there is a true equal, true double, or true proportion in the spangled heavens. Likewise, a true astronomer..will never imagine that  the proportions of night and day, night and day to the month, the month to the year, the stars to one another are eternal and subject to no deviation. It is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth. 
<cite>Simple Republic by Plato, Chapter 7</cite>
</div>
<p>Socrates clearly is against having any fixed or constant value to define the universe and any movements within it. According to this, any established constant would eventually be rejected the more humans learn about the universe. This is what happened to the constant gravity advocated by Newton which was overturned by the Theory of Relativity of Einstein. However, Einstein also established his own constant as the speed of light, and this must also be overturned if we are to unify Physics with Metaphysics and even Quantum Physics. The need to overturn the speed of light as a constant is apparent in Socrates saying that sight (made possible by photons) is not the proper way to measure movement in outerspace:</p>
<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
The starry heaven is wrought on a visible ground. The most perfect of visible things is far inferior to the true motions of absolute swiftness and slowness which are relative to each other. They carry with them that which is contained in them. These are to be apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.
</div>
<br>
<h3 id="lets-fix-relativity">Let&rsquo;s Fix Relativity!</h3>
<p>To fix the theory of Relativity, we recall that the Standard Model of Physics divides all forces into four categories which we arrange in a hierarchy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gravitation</li>
<li>Electromagnetic</li>
<li>Weak</li>
<li>Strong</li>
</ol>
<p>Material objects are made possible by atoms which are held together by the Strong force. The movement of such objects is governed by the classical mechanics established by Netwon, such as F = ma and the law of conservation of mass. This means that you can force-push a ball-mass in order to move or accelerate it.</p>
<p>The movements by the Weak and Electromagnetic forces, such as those in radioactive decay and magnetism, were observed later and established by Maxwell&rsquo;s equations and the law of conservation of energy. Unlike matter, you cannot force-push electricity to make it travel farther. Instead, you use a capacitor to gather the electricity in coils and add strength.</p>
<p>The difference between the movements of matter and electromagnetism was then thought to be caused by a semi-material thing called ether which permeated space.  Einstein disproved ether by using light as the other semi-material thing to &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; the two behaviors. This is because, from his earlier papers about visible  light and the photo-electric effect, he realized that light was both a material photon particle and non-material spectrum wave. He called this unification as &ldquo;special relativity&rdquo; or E = mc<sup>2</sup></p>
<div class="squote ein">Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the conservation of energy and the law of the conservation of mass.. By means of the theory of relativity they have been united into one law.<cite>Einstein, Relativity</cite></div>
<br>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/emc.png" alt=""></p>
<br>
<h3 id="not-so-fast-einstein">Not so fast, Einstein!</h3>
<p>He then extended his theory, as General Relativity, to the movement of objects in outer space which was governed by the force of Gravitation. This led to the ideas of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/10/what-are-gravitational-waves-ligo-astronomy-science/">gravitational waves</a>, worm holes, and <a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2021/04/emergent-gravity-dark-matter-is-a-mythical-beast-a-figment-of-our-ignorance-watch-todays-galaxy-stre">dark matter</a>. While his Special Relativity is bullet-proof, his General Relativity is full of holes. While gravitational waves have been proven, worm holes and dark matter have not. Many physicists have been wasting real money building dark matter detectors, money that could&rsquo;ve been used for space travel or even better Covid vaccines.</p>
<p>Here, we turn on our Socratic dialectics to troubleshoot Einstein&rsquo;s understanding. Our principle states that in observing the heavens, there should be no constant and that light should not be used to build the core principle. Socrates says that future astronomers would likely fall for this trap and that&rsquo;s exactly what happened to Einstein*. We suspect it to be the cause for the mistakes of General Relativity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*We can even work backwards and see the same mistakes from Newton, Ptolemy, and Aristotle who went with the obvious, instead of digging deeper into the metaphysical or noumenal causes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why did Einstein do it? For this, we need to go back to 1905:</p>
<div class="squote einblah">
<p>a mathematical description of this kind has no physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by “time”.. We have so far defined only an “A time” and a “B time.” We have not defined a common “time” for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we establish by definition that the “time” required by light to travel from A to B equals the “time” it requires to travel from B to A.
</p>
<cite>Einstein, On The Electrodynamics Of Moving Bodies, 1905</cite>  </div>
<br>
<p>Einstein did it because he couldn&rsquo;t define time.</p>
<p>All movement happens within a space and the all observations of such movement happens within time. Thus, all formulation of the rules on movement must take into account space and time. The movement of everyday objects are quite slow and so space is just spot Z occupied by the object now. Spot Y is the space that it occupied a while ago. Likewise, time Z is the time at last observation and time Y is the time at first or earlier observation.</p>
<p>However, the movement of electromagnetic particles such as light and electricity can be very fast and is faster than the human brain can process. This is the same weakness that makes a person see himself as <a href="/articles/social/david-hume-idea-of-self">one self instead of 3 billion selves</a>.</p>
<p>Without supercomputers to visualize tensor calculus, Einstein had to use thought experiments (his imagination) in order to visualize what would happen to fast-moving objects. In order to unify two simultaneous observations, he used the speed of light to glue them together, by making it a constant.</p>
<p>Speed is the amount of space covered per unit of time. So if you declare speed to be constant, then you must also declare space and time to be changeable. To Einstein, the cause of this change is gravity which is thought to be rooted in mass. This then leads to the idea of spacetime being a fabric that is bendable by mass. This fabric idea naturally led to the following sub-ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gravitational waves that ripple through spacetime</li>
<li>Dark Matter that glues galaxies together since there is not enough ordinary matter to create the mass to create the gravity to hold them together</li>
<li>Black holes or worm holes that are holes in the fabric that open to another part of the universe</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/c.png" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>The observations of classical mechanics (left) can be done with the same observer. Those of special relativity, however, require using a higher c (speed of light) as a tool to unify the observations. This c takes the form of the lasers in the LIGO observatory that is used to observe gravitational waves that 'move' space itself</figcaption>

</div>

<figcaption>Veritasium has the guts to expose the sophistry of Einstein in setting the 2-way speed of light as a constant</figcaption>
<p>To explain such strange movements of pure gravity within the fabric of spacetime, General Relativity has no choice but to resort to material solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>phantom wormholes that actually pierce spacetime to suck matter and spew it out in another dimension,</li>
<li>phantom dark matter that glues galaxies in place or bend light to create gravitational lensing</li>
</ul>
<p>Such phantom matter and holes have never been found simply because they never existed and could never exist. They are merely the necessary consequence of artificially turning spacetime into a fabric which was caused by Einstein setting light as a constant &ndash; all because he couldn&rsquo;t define time!  This is why Relativity &ldquo;kind of&rdquo; works for classical mechanics (which is of lower rank), just as a CEO can &ldquo;kind of&rdquo; do the work of his company&rsquo;s janitor, but the janitor can never do the work of the CEO.</p>
<p>The result of Einstein&rsquo;s sophistry is the concept of warp drives, star gates, and &ldquo;back to the future&rdquo; time travel where Marty McFly magically disappears after changing the past of his parents. But none of them will ever exist or come true.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="the-solution-gravitational-signatures">The Solution: Gravitational Signatures</h2>
<p>We fix relativity by adhering to the rules* which Socrates mentioned earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photons must not be used to build the solution</li>
<li>There must be no constant</li>
<li>The solution and cause of movement must be inherent to the object, as opposed to being external</li>
<li>The solution must be universal, that is, applicable to all five layers of the Greek or Asian model of Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>*This adherence of logic to timeless metaphysical truths is the key aspect of the dialectical method that makes it different from the scientific method which is based on evidence supplied by the limited physical senses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We start by fitting Relativity to the 5-layer model of the Greeks. We see that General Relativity cannot really extend to the Gravitational layer because its domain is fundamentally in Electromagnetism as a consequence of using light or c, just as the domain of Classical Mechanics is the Strong force layer and cannot extend to Gravitation.</p>
<p>Galaxies do not act like balls that explode or push each other away when they collide. Instead, they pass through each other and eventually merge. On the other hand, Special Relativity can extend down to the Weak force because there is not much difference between Electromagnetism and the Weak force, as proven by the Electroweak interaction.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/layers.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We match the Standard Model of Physics to the 5-layer Model, originally called 5-elements, of the Greeks and Asia. We see that the theoretical advances in Physics in the 20th century are tiny compared to those from the 17th-19th centuries. The latter advanced a lot thanks to Newton correctly starting from the EM layer (3rd rank) through his work in optics, and then going up to the gravitational layer (2nd rank) through his use of optics to observe the movement of comets.</p>
<p>However, Newton was unable to break through the etherial layer (1st rank) because the metaphysics of the time were limited to bible verses*. Unable to break into the metaphysical layer, the minds of physicists have since declared it as off-limits and have gone instead downwards into the material layer where observation and prediction is so easy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Newton tried to make predictions based on patterns iin the Bible</p>

<p>Since to Socrates, the metaphysical dimension is superior to the physical dimension, we will replace mass m with G which represents the inherent gravity in every discrete perceivable thing, entity, or mind. This G is called the &ldquo;gravitational signature&rdquo; and is really supposed to be D or Dharma. But that would turn away Westerners who have a distaste for non-Western ideas (which is a no-no if we are to unify the human species and put everyone &lsquo;on the same page&rsquo;). So we can stick with G as invented by the British Newton. Like Newton, Socrates would think that this G is inherent to the body as what &ldquo;objects carry in them&rdquo;. But unlike Newton who believed that G came from a material mass, Socrates would believe that it came from an immaterial &ldquo;true nature&rdquo; which the Hindus call Dharma. In this way, G still ends up as D if the thinking person chases it down. You could even say that G is the metaphysical DNA of everything in existence that dictates what movements it can do, and actually manifests as the DNA in physical living cells.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/egl.png" alt="E=mc2 alternative"></p>
<p>This G then has five versions, one for each of five layers represented by <sub>l</sub>. In this way, the resulting equation E = G<sub>l</sub> serves as a template that holds all the equations of potential motion:</p>
<ul>
<li>w = mg is E = G<sub>l</sub> in the Material layer</li>
<li>Feynman equations are E = G<sub>l</sub> in the Radioactive layer</li>
<li>E = mc<sup>2</sup> is E = G<sub>l</sub> in the Radiant layer</li>
<li>E = G<sub>B-A</sub> is E = G<sub>l</sub> in the Spatial layer</li>
<li>E = G<sub>AB</sub> is E = G<sub>l</sub> in the Aetheric layer</li>
<li>E = G<sub>d</sub> is E = G<sub>l</sub> in the Metaphysical layer</li>
</ul>
<p>A gravitational signature produces attractive or repulsive motion by its affinity or difference with the signatures of other existing objects, entities, and minds within the same layer. Lower layers are affected by higher layers, but higher layers are unaffected by the lower. Light is affected by gravity, but gravity is not affected by light.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the strong layer, it is the attraction of the gluons that lead to matter or its repulsion as nuclear explosions</li>
<li>In the weak layer, it is the decay of one particle into another or its nondecay</li>
<li>In the electromagnetic layer, it is the attraction of opposite charges and or repulsion of like charges</li>
<li>In the gravitational layer, it manifests as the attraction to massive objects or repulsion to immaterial objects</li>
<li>In the metaphysical layer, it is the attraction of related ideas and minds and the replusion of opposing ones</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/btsband.jpg" alt="Korean BTS quantum physics"></p>
<figcaption>Gravitational signatures explain why some people are attracted and gravitate towards KPop while others are repulsed by them. In theory, this means that peace and harmony can be achieved granularly by knowing the Gravitational signatures of everyone in order to reduce the repulsion of minds, and generally by imposing higher-layer ideas like virtue (this virtue-based socio-political system is then the job of Supersociology which is a subset of Social Superphysics).</figcaption>
<p>Next, we replace c or the constant speed of light with s as the linear speed limit* of the universe so that E = ms<sup>2</sup>. In this way, can say that gravitational waves travel within this linear speed limit, instead of saying that they travel at the speed of light. This is to switch gravitation from being subordinate to photons, to being superior to it, in accordance with our 5-layer model.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*We can say that s is a sort of limiting tensor that is part of the Higgs field. In this way, the thing that gives electrons their mass is the same thing that limits their speed in spacetime. Einstein had all the ingredients to arrive at both. However, he never seems to have asked why the speed of light is the way it is, and instead just set it as so. Physicists would then object and say that the Higgs field is not ether, and so we will instead refer to it as <a href="/research/spinoza/simple-ethics/part-1/definitions/">the Spinoza substance</a> which is all-pervading and self-aware as the crude layer of the Brahma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Existence were a corporation engaged in the business of creating Reality, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Material layer would be the workers</li>
<li>The Electroweak layer would be the team leaders and supervisors</li>
<li>Gravitation would be the managers</li>
<li>The Higgs (Citta in our Sanskrit version) would be the CEO and executives</li>
<li>The Metaphysical layer would be the mysterious board members that no one ever saw, but the existence of the company implies that they are there behind the scenes</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/layersegl.png" alt="Science limited box"></p>
<p>Everything is in motion because every signature interacts obviously or non-obviously with each other. This thing that causes stars and dust to gather or disperse is the same thing that causes people to form societies or leave society, and ideas to coalesce into complex ideas or be analyzed into their basic idea.</p>
<p>This inquiry on the gravitational signature of everything is super laborious and is similar to Thomas Edison looking for the perfect filament for the light bulb. His search led to the saying that goes something like success is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.</p>
<p>This is why, as Socrates advised, we should just keep this idea as a theory until the proper resource allocation system is developed to make the search practical. This is why we started with <a href="/pantrynomics">fixing Economics first</a>.</p>
<div class="squote socrates">
<p>Their pursuit will be valuable for our objects if all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and connection with one another and become considered in their mutual affinities. Until then, there is no profit in pursuing them.</p>
<cite>The Simple Republic</cite>
</div>
<p>To avoid the need to laboriously find the inherent G in massive bodies and their mutual affinities with other G&rsquo;s, Newton took the easy path and defined g (gravity) as a constant.</p>
<p>Likewise, to avoid having to laboriously find the mass of everything that is moving in the universe at different speeds, Einstein took the easy path and set c (speed of light) as a constant.</p>
<p>The result is that their theories are not universal and will fall apart once new perceptions about the universe are obtained. It would be like setting minimum wage permanently at $10/hour hoping that it would magically keep up with inflation.</p>
<!--  It would work for some years, until it would need to be overturned as the mind upgrades its perceptions. -->
<br>
<h2 id="why-general-relativity-holds">Why General Relativity Holds</h2>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s general relativity only holds because the simultaniety of time is rooted in the observation action and the observation action is based on the generation of the idea (or feeling) to start observing.</p>
<p>The speed of the generation of ideas (or feelings) holds a ratio to the speed of the generation of gravitational signatures or the speed of creating discrete things within the universe (since everything is an idea). <strong>The speed limit of the universe, whether it be on photons of the Electromagnetic layer or gravitational waves of the Gravitational layer, thus is totally dependent on the speed of this generation.</strong></p>
<p>From here we can assert, in line with Socrates, that the speed of light is not constant. Rather it is slowly increasing, proportional to the accelerated expansion of spacetime, the more the universe interacts with itself and creates discrete new entities as a result of the interactions.</p>
<p>An analogy is a mind that has just woken up. In the beginning, the mind is slow to think as it still has inertia. But after a few minutes, it starts thinking faster until it reaches its normal speed.</p>
<p>We can thus think of the Big Bang as the physical universe waking up as giant mind or matrix or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma">Brahma</a> that generates physical reality. Physical time then is the gap between two perceptions done by the Mind of the Universe within Itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing constant c with variable s representing the changing speed limit of the universe</li>
<li>Replacing mass m with the inherent gravitational signature G of the object, entity, or mind that is applicable to all five physical layers and even to the metaphysical layer</li>
<li>Defining time as the gap between two observations, instead of being the simultaniety of events</li>
</ul>
<p>There are of course other universes in the multiverse where the speed limit is actually constant. But such universes won&rsquo;t have much for us to think about since nothing would change in it. There are others that are slowing down.</p>
<p>From this, we can make another important assertion that General Relativity (GR) only holds for things that are measured by light:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GR only works on gravitational lensing because light is measured</li>
  <li>Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light because lasers are used to measure it. This means a lot of things move faster than light, but are never visible nor measureable by anything electronic.</li>  
</ul>
<br>
<h2 id="so-whats-the-use-of-gravitational-signatures">So What&rsquo;s the Use of Gravitational Signatures?</h2>
<p>Its immediate use is to declare <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/150964/one-idea-to-explain-dark-matter-ultralight-bosons-fails-the-test/">dark matter</a> as non-existent so that physicists can stop spending real money building dark matter detectors.</p>
<p>By this vein, we can say that the large hadron collider is also somewhat a waste of money because the ancient Greeks were able to classify all forces into five layers at far less cost. Or rather, it was a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/07/05/how-much-does-it-cost-to-find-a-higgs-boson/">$4.7 billion test</a> to see whether ancient knowledge was correct.</p>
<p>Instead, the money should be spent on gravity-detectors like LIGO to find the &ldquo;G&rdquo; of stars and galaxies and then work backwards to find the G of matter (rocks, metals, objects).</p>
<p>This is why we can make a conjecture that Einstein actually stifled science by leading physicists on a wild-goose-chase for dark matter and wormholes. Satellite Engineers would discover discrepancies in the timings of their satellites anyway, which would then create relativity theories naturally without the limiting c.</p>

<figcaption>Physicists are preoccupied at the lowest layers of the visual kind because sight is the easiest perception for humans. They also smash particles for no practical purpose, since those smashed particles are unnatural to begin with and quickly fizzle out</figcaption>
<p>Instead of using expensive detectors, we use Socrates to solve the problems with General Relativity:</p>
<ul>
<li>The expansion of space is caused by gravitational signatures of galaxies repelling each other, not by <a href="https://www.futurity.org/dark-energy-dark-matter-universe-expansion-2543202-2/">dark energy</a></li>
<li>Gravitational lensing is caused by the gravitational signature of the intervening galaxy</li>
<li>Galaxies are held together by the gravitational signature in their center as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_star_(Newtonian_mechanics)">supermassive dark stars</a> (blackholes), not by dark matter</li>
</ul>
<p>Practically, the knowledge of how these signatures work can allow humans to <strong>harness any motion</strong> by converting them to force or movement equations. Currently, only the movements in the Material and Electromagnetic layer is artificially harnessed by humans, more commonly as combustion and electric motors. The power of gravity and spacetime is not utilized because Netwon&rsquo;s Physics couldn&rsquo;t break into the higher metaphysical layer because of the absurdities in Roman Catholicism, and so it settled at the bottom Material layer.</p>
<p>So far, only Buddhist and Hindu monks seem to have started properly from the Metaphysical layer and therefore have learned how to use gravitation (for example, to levitate themselves). However, the downside is that they don&rsquo;t go down to the lowest Material layer to actually invent practical mechanical things. Why would a CEO work down to be a janitor in the Material layer when he can instead rise up to be a board member in the Metaphysical dimension?</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/a0b1.png" alt="Buddhist metaphysics gravity"></p>
<figcaption>Levitation has been practiced by floating monks in Tibet, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/27/politics/pentagon-ufo-videos/index.html">floating UFOs in the US</a> and Iran, and by the ancient Egyptians who levitated huge blocks to form the pyramids, using the same natural principle that expands the universe.</figcaption>
<p>Superphysics aims to solve this by uniting understandings of the materialist scientist and the metaphysician monk, just as we combined the understandings of Einstein with that of Socrates. Like Socrates (and David Hume), it does not go on to inquire into the cause or Creator of every G, but limits itself to knowing what is G. This is really to avoid the karma-police which ensures that the illusion or business of reality goes on. An example is Jesus who was punished by Nature with torture and crucifixion for doing unnatural miracles. Buddhist monks are aware of karma and avoid rocking the boat too much.</p>
<!-- the  (trust me, you can't evade karma even if the time factor makes it seem that there is none).  -->
<p>Future posts will explain how these can be applied via Material Superphysics to create spacetime technology for levitation, teleportation, and spacetime power-generation that are all &lsquo;fueled&rsquo; by gravity, and is impossible to achieve under the paradigm of the old Relativitiy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Levitation can lead to flying cargo ships that will never get stuck at the Suez Canal</li>
<li>Teleportation can lead to spaceships that can travel to Mars and other planets far quicker, cheaper, and safer than the explosive rockets of SpaceX</li>
<li>Spacetime power-generation can produce energy 24/7 from the expansion of spacetime without creating carbon emissions</li>
</ul>
<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more!</p>
<p>Gravitational signatures don&rsquo;t just work for movements in the five physical layers but also for movements in the metaphysical layer. This theory can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>move public opinon or feelings towards a policy proposal or political candidate by knowing the current G of society. Is your society headed for a golden age, or is it on a decline? This is the job of <a href="/social">Social Superphysics</a></li>
<li>attract or retain the right employees or minds for your company and maximize their productivity by finding out their motivational G that might be different from the material particle called money. This is the job of <a href="/pantrynomics">pantrynomics</a></li>
<li>know how temporally far a person is from a disease by comparing his G with that of the disease, so that he can move away from or prevent the disease. This is the job of <a href="/medical">Medical Superphysics</a></li>
<li>and so on..</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re supposed to start with applying E = G<sub>l</sub> on Economics so that we can get the resources for all of this, <a href="/articles/pantrynomics/the-eagle">the next post</a> will explain how it can be used to find the real price of everything and prevent recessions, debt &amp; financial crises, as well as poverty &amp; inequality</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Update June 29, 2021: changed movement energy to inherent energy and F = ma to w = mg to make it consistent with E = G<sub>l</sub> as the rest or potential state</li>
