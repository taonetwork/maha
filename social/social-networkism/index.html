          <blockquote>
<p>Overhauled on July 1, 2021 to harmonize Socrates with Hume and Smith</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our proposed science of <a href="/pantrynomics">pantrynomics</a> is based on a new paradigm that sees individual entities as naturally part of a larger group of entities called a society.</p>
<p>Unlike normal definitions of society*, our definition describes a society* as a kind of metaphysical organism or mind that is made up of individual minds that agree to be part of that society. Since materialistic science views minds as coming from the physical brain, then we instead use the word &lsquo;soul&rsquo; to refer to a mind that can exist without a physical brain or neural network.</p>
<p>This makes the soul free from physical limitations and gives it flexible qualities that are similar to sound and music, such as the effortless communication and conveyance of feelings. For example, a tune can change from melodic to rhythmic gradually or immediately, just as a mind can choose to switch from eating American food to Chinese food gradually or immediately.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/soulsociety.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>*A society is three or more entities working towards a common goal or interest. A partnership is a bit different as it needs to two entities as a minimum. Thus, a childless husband and wife is a partnership. It becomes a society after having a child. A family is a common example of a society. A basketball team is a society, different from tennis-doubles players that form a partnership. Since a team is a society, it also is subject to social cycles which manifest as winning and losing streaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="squote hume" data-sal="slide-right">
The minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations. No one can be actuated by any affection which others are not susceptible to. In wound-up strings, the motion of one string communicates itself to the rest. So all the affections readily pass from one person to another, and beget correspondent movements in every human creature.
<cite>The Simple Treatise Of Human Nature Section 1, Part 3, Book 3</cite>
</div>
<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
Few people ever reflect that from the evil of other men, something of evil is communicated to themselves. And so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others becomes more and more difficult to repress
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 10</cite>
</div>
<p>This flexibility lets souls send and receive invisible information via intuition. In our music analogy, the orchestra can get visual hints from the conductor to speed up the tempo or make the strings louder.</p>
<p>This flexible quality also lets souls merge and agree, as proven by the phrase &ldquo;the meeting of minds&rdquo; or &ldquo;being on the same page&rdquo;. This would be like an orchestra adding more instruments that jive with its style.</p>
<p>Matter and physical objects, on the contrary, cannot occupy the same physical &lsquo;page&rsquo; nor meet at a &lsquo;place&rsquo; without losing their individual identity.</p>
<p>We then call this merging of the minds or souls as a society. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A family begins when a man&rsquo;s soul agrees to unite with a woman&rsquo;s soul which then adds another soul as their child</li>
<li>A company begins when the souls of the incorporators agree to be bound into a business organization</li>
<li>A sports team begins when the souls of playes agree to play together</li>
</ul>
<p>Human society began as families agreeing to work together for mutual benefit, which we call <a href="/supersociology/common-interest">the common interest</a>. We can say that the common interest is the conscience of the soul of society, just as a person&rsquo;s own conscience represents his soul&rsquo;s best interest for himself. We refrain from doing a bad thing because our conscience will implant the feeling of guilt in our minds, as a natural warning about the resulting consequence or karma.</p>
<p>Societies then agree and merge with other societies to form nations, which can merge to form confederations, which can finally form a global human society.</p>

<p>The entire human species is therefore one big society made up of all human minds. David Hume and Socrates use the analogy of citizens being the individual souls with their government as the oversoul. Quesnay uses the analogy of cells in a body. In Hinduism, this is similar to the atman making up the paramatman.</p>
<p>If common interest naturally makes humans unite into societies, why do we see so much inequality, hate, and conflict?</p>
<br>
<h3 id="the-ego-separates-the-union-of-souls">The Ego Separates the Union of Souls</h3>
<p>The flexibility of the soul (or malleability of the mind) is the main quality that allows it to connect and merge with other souls, whether it be of animals, plants, or humans. The loss of this flexibility (as the rigidity of the mind) disconnects the soul from others and confines it to itself.</p>
<p>This confinement builds ego, which is the feeling for the self. When left unchecked, this ego leads to disagreements, disunity, and eventual conflict. The more democratic the society, the more difficult it is to maintain unity:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
Rancorous and virulent factions which are inseparable from small democracies. Those factions have so frequently divided their people and disturbed the peace of their democratic governments.

<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
Are you not aware that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable? ..But reason will not allow us to believe this. It will not let us believe that the soul, in its truest nature, is full of variety, difference, and dissimilarity. 
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 10</cite>
</div>
<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
When the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division, the several parts are just.

</div>
<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
There is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself' because the master is also the servant and the servant is the master since the same person is denoted. It really means that in the human soul there is a better and a worse principle. When the better has the worse under control, then a man the master of himself. When due to evil education or association, the better principle is overwhelmed by the worse principle, then the man is blamed and is called "unprincipled" or the slave of the self.

<p>It would be easier to prevent the growth of ego by pointing out that no one is perfect:</p>
<ul>
<li>A beautiful woman will have most of her attention on her physical looks, making her deficient in intellect</li>
<li>An intelligent man will have most of his attention on abstract ideas, making him deficient in bodily strength or looks</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, the common interest is overall personal well-being</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<ul>
<li>A popular politician will spend most of his time interacting with the masses, instead of spending time for policy research</li>
<li>A bright researcher will have many good policy-ideas, but will not have the popularity or connections to have them implemented</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, the common interest is implementing the right policies</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<ul>
<li>A skilled app developer can create a superior app, but might not have the skill to market it</li>
<li>An active marketer can make any app go viral, but might not know how to make an app in the first place</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, the common interest spreading useful apps</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
Then in our city, the language of harmony and concord will be more often heard than in any other. <!-- When anyone is well or ill, the universal word will be 'with me it is well' or 'it is ill.' --> They will have their pleasures and pains in common. They will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call 'my own'. Having this common interest, they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain. The is because the guardians will have a community of women and children. We called this unity of feeling as the greatest good.
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 5, Chapter 2</cite>
</div>
<p>Thus, the key to common interest is to group everyone according to ideas that would interest them. This would let them gravitate to it and hopefully lower their egos in order to explore that idea further. For example, we sometimes go to Meetups about the food, technology, artists, and sports that we like. Nowadays, the internet, social networks, and messaging apps like Whatsapp, Zalo, and Viber help us to access such interests virtually.</p>
<!--  manage such variety and disparity of minds if they were grouped by their inherent qualities, manifesting as their personal interests. Adam likes to catch fish, Barbara likes to sing, Charlie likes to write software, Dan likes to play instruments. We can group Barbara and Dan together since their interests are similar. Barbara would probably be happier with Dan than with Charlie who likes quiet concentration. 

This personal interest then forms what Socrates calls the 'true nature' and what the Hindus call the 'svadharma'. But how would someone know his true personal interest? 

Socrates called this process of knowing as 'dialectics'.

<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
The power of dialectic lets the reason attain that other sort of knowledge using the hypotheses as steps into a world which is above hypotheses, so that she may soar beyond them into the original principle. 
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 6</cite>
</div>

Unlike epistemology that is based on logic alone, dialects is based on feelings. Dialectics is a method that forces the individual to look beyond the self, into something higher, so that his mind will see any issue from a higher level. This is different from debate which preserves the ego and is competitive in nature. Dialectics goes beyond competition or argument in order to arrive at a solution instead of a victory, by probing the issue and doing trial and error. A regulator then implements this system to ensure that society stays as a cohesive unit.

<h3 id="facebook-is-a-personal-network-not-a-social-network">Facebook is a Personal Network, Not a Social Network</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, some social apps group people not to build the common interest, but merely funnel advertisements more effectively. An example is Facebook which lets its users add other users that they like, creating a <strong>personal network</strong> instead of a proper social network.  Those users can then post whatever is in their personal interest which then creates a personal bubble or echo chamber that might go against other bubbles. If left unchecked, it can lead to online conflict, followed by real physical conflict or harm.</p>
<!-- traps its users in an echo chamber that can help it serve ads that strike our personal or group interest. 

In addition, Facebook has no active regulator to keep its users united or prevent conflict. This creates disharmony which increases into radicalism since the interactions are often left unchecked* in the name of freedom. -->
<!-- Facebook is a similar system that groups people according to their interests and allows them to network with each other. However, the main difference is that it has  -->
<!-- Because Facebook has no regulator, anyone can add users according to their whim. Therefore, it is really a personal network instead of a real social network since personal interest, and not common interest, dominates. This creates a  -->
<blockquote>
<p>In order to earn more from ads, some social networks focus on user quantity instead of user quality. Our system is different because it does not earn from advertising primarily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A true social network therefore is one that encourages personal interest as long as it is within the common interest. This necessitates a regulator, just as an early society has a chieftain and a modern society has a President or Prime Minister. The key qualification of this regulator is his understanding of the common interest as to keep the society unified and whole. His whole moral authority depends on this.</p>
<p>Socrates' version of the regulators are the guardians who are morally upright:</p>
<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
The guardians will be delivered from all these evils. Their life will be more blessed than the life of Olympic victors. The Olympic victor is happy to receive a part only of the blessedness secured to our citizens. The citizens' victory is the salvation of the State at the public cost. The crown with which they and their children have is the fulness of all that life needs.
</div>
<!-- 
 therefore not based on arbitrary friend-additions, but on real social contracts or promises, as desribed by David Hume. This is why our proposed economic system is based on social contracts, as a tool to realize the common interest. Thus we define dialectical social networkism as a paradigm that uses Dialectics to implement a system of social contracts, under a moral authority, in order to generate sustainable happiness for the self through its society and beyond.

In future posts, we will explain how this moral authority can be implemented by machine learning in order to create what Socrates calls guardians.
 -->
<p>We implement his guardians as <a href="/articles/superphysics/what-is-isaiah">ISAIAH</a> which is the machine learning that will regulate our proposed social pantrynomic network which implements our concept of social networkism desribed here. Thus, social networkism is made up of the following ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The soul of society being made up of individual souls that merge and dissociate flexibly</li>
<li>A common interest that unifies such souls together into a society</li>
<li>A moral leader or regulator to protect and grow that common interest</li>
