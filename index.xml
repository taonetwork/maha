      <title>The Market Equilibrium Fallacy</title>

      <description>The biggest fallacy of Economics is Market Equilibrium which is taught in basic economics or &amp;lsquo;Econ101&amp;rsquo; everywhere as the supply and demand curve forming an &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; and meeting in a state called &amp;lsquo;exact equilibrium&amp;rsquo;. Smith exposed this as mercantile sophistry in the 18th century, then called the &amp;lsquo;balance of trade&amp;rsquo;. To prove that this idea of &amp;lsquo;balance&amp;rsquo; is the same in essence with the &amp;lsquo;equilibrium&amp;rsquo; of economics, let&amp;rsquo;s compare the philosophy behind both ideas.</description>

      <description>The Great Tao is simplified to the &#39;Brahma&#39; to unify it with Hinduism.The &#34;One&#34; is simplified to the &#39;Supreme Tao&#39; which represents the superme consciousness. In this way, Brahma and the Supreme are analogous to the mind and consciousness, in the same way that a computer has a RAM and CPU -- Simplification Table  Tao Te Ching Hindu version Superphysics version Computer Analogy     Tao Dharma True Nature Design Specfications   tao rta dharma Mother Nature Design Constraints   The Great Brahma Totality of Existence RAM   The One Saguna Brahma Supreme Entity CPU   Mystery Maya Illusion Hardware limitations     Chapter 1: The Names of the Tao 1 The Tao is &amp;lsquo;nature&amp;rsquo; and has two versions:</description>

      <description>Chapter 4: The Tao is Nirguna or Nothingness  1 The Tao is like the emptiness of a vessel. In our use of it, we must be on our guard against all fullness. How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things!
2 We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of things. We should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into agreement with the obscurity of others.</description>

      <description>Chapter 7: The Impartial Spectator 1 The Tao thus creates Heaven and earth to last eternally for the sake of the Tao or True Nature, and not for the tao or Mother Nature.
2 Therefore, the knower of the Tao puts his own person last position, yet will be in the foremost position. He treats his self as if it were another self* in order to realize his Tao or True Nature.</description>

      <description>Chapter 32: The Process of Creation 1 The Tao or True Nature, considered as unchanging, has no name.
2 In its primordial simplicity it may be small. Yet the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a king could guard and hold the Tao, everything would spontaneously submit themselves to him.
3 Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord.</description>

      <description>Chapter 14: The Supreme Tao or the One has Physical and Metaphysical Dimensions 1 We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it &amp;lsquo;the Uniformity.&amp;rsquo;
We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it &amp;lsquo;the Inaudible.&amp;rsquo;
We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it &amp;lsquo;the Subtle.&amp;rsquo;
With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain &amp;lsquo;The One&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Chapter 24: Brahma 1 There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth.
It was still and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change. It reaches everywhere yet in no danger of being exhausted! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things.
2 I do not know its name, but I call it as an effect of the Way or Course of the Tao. Making an effort further, I call it Brahma [originally &amp;lsquo;The Great&amp;rsquo;].</description>

      <description>Chapter 11: The Aether The 30 spokes of a wheel unite in the one hub. A wheel&amp;rsquo;s usefulness is in this empty space in the hub.Clay is made into pots. A pot&amp;rsquo;s usefulness is in its empty hollowness.
An apartment has its door and windows cut out from the walls. An apartment&amp;rsquo;s usefulness is in the empty space inside it.
Therefore, what is empty is useful, what is not empty is to be worked on.</description>

      <description>Chapter 36: Karma 1 Before a man:
 inhales, he must first exhale.  weakens another, that other must be strong first. overthrows another, that other must be raised first. despoils another, that other must have gifts first.  This is called &amp;lsquo;Hiding the light of his procedure.&amp;rsquo;
2 The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong.
3 Fishes should not be taken from the deep. Instruments for the profit of a state should not be shown to the people.</description>

      <description>Chapter 38: Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety 1 Those who possessed in highest degree the attributes of the Tao did not seek to show them. Therefore, they possessed them in the fullest measure.
Those who possessed those attributes in a lower degree sought how not to lose them. Therefore, they did not possess them in the fullest measure.
2 Those who possessed in the highest degree those attributes:
 did nothing with a purpose, and had no need to do anything  Those who possessed them in a lower degree:</description>

      <description>Chapter 15: The Masters of the Tao 1 The skillful masters of the Tao in the old times had a subtle and exquisite penetration to comprehend its mysteries. They were also deep as to be beyond men&amp;rsquo;s knowledge. But I will describe them.
2 They looked :
 shrinking like those who wade through a stream in winter irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them grave like a guest in awe of his host evanescent like ice that is melting away unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water.</description>

      <description>-- Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in the middle of August, three months after the US announced a complete withdrawal of its troops. The fall surprised a lot of people especially since the US spent 20 years building the country from scratch. It was the job of the Afghan army to defend their country and they were doing a decent job before 2021, despite the corruption of their leaders.
This all changed when Trump announced a withdrawal of the US military by May 1, 2021, a policy which was continued by Biden.</description>

      <description>Chapter 16: Meditation and Fellow-feeling with Everything leads to the Tao 1 The state of nothingness should be brought to the utmost degree.
The state of stillness should be guarded with unwearying vigour.
All things alike go through their processes of activity. Afterwards, they return to their original state.
When plants have displayed their luxuriant growth, they return to their root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness.</description>

      <description>Chapter 62: The Reward of the Tao or True Nature 1 The Tao or True Nature has, of all things, the most honoured place.
2 Its admirable words can purchase honour. Its admirable deeds can raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not abandoned by It.
3 The offering of symbols of rank to the sovereign, who occupies his place as the Son of Heaven, might be so big as to fill both hands.</description>

      <description>Chapter 53: Excess Wealth is Contrary to the Tao or True Nature 1 If I suddenly became known and put into a position to conduct a government according to the Brahma, I would be most afraid of a boastful display.
2 The Brahma is very level and easy. But people love the by-ways.
3 The people&amp;rsquo;s courtyards and buildings are all well-kept. But their fields are ill-cultivated and their granaries very empty.</description>

      <description>Chapter 29: Society 1 If any one should wish to get the kingdom or society for himself and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed.
A society is a spirit-like thing. It cannot be got by active doing.
 He who wins it destroys it. He who holds it in his grasp loses it.  2 The course and nature of things is such that:</description>

      <description>Chapter 57: The State Should Have Concise but Efficient Laws 1 A state may be ruled by measures of correction. Weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity. But the kingdom is made one&amp;rsquo;s own only by freedom from action and purpose.
2 The multiplication of prohibitive laws increases the poverty of the people.
The more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan;</description>

      <description>Chapter 75: Economic Policy 1 The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors.
2 The people are difficult to govern because of the excessive agency of their superiors in governing them.
3 The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus, it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it.</description>

      <description>Islamic terrorism became known worldwide because of the 9/11 attacks, which overshadowed previous attacks from the 1970’s. Since then, terrorism has been unfortunately and unfairly connected to Islam.
This connection is easily brought back up to mind and conversation whenever a terrorist attack occurs, whether it was rooted in Islam or not. Whenever a terrorist attack occurs, the common expectation nowadays is for it to be caused by a disgruntled Muslim.</description>

I am sincere to those who are sincere with me and to those who are not sincere with me. Thus, all get to be sincere.</description>

      <description>Chapter 67: Patience, Frugality, Humility 1 All the world says that, while my Tao or personal True Nature is great, it appears to be inferior to other systems of teaching.
But it is just its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other system, only its smallness would be known for a long time! 2 But I have three precious things which I prize:</description>

2 There is an originating and all-comprehending principle in my words, and an authoritative law for the things which I enforce. It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me.</description>

      <description>The invisible hand concept by Adam Smith is one of the most important ideas in our proposed economic science, making up the Second Law of Value which then leads to the effort theory of value which replaces the arbitrary marginal pricing of Neoclassical Economics.
As it is so fundamental, it has to be thoroughly explained. Unfortunately, the invisible hand concept has been corrupted so much by Paul Samuelson in order to advance his own corrupt neoclassical synthesis.</description>

      <description>In Hume&amp;rsquo;s essay of the ideal commonwealth, he writes his plan for the ideal government:
 The people are split into 100 counties which are split into 100 districts The people vote for a district representative. This creates 100 district representatives per district and a total of 10,000 district representatives The 100 district reps vote for 1 senator to represent their country.  Its unique feature is The Court of Competitors which we rename as The Council of Opposition and is made up of the losers of the senatorial race who lose by landslide.</description>

      <description>I shall endeavour to explain [exchangable value] as fully and distinctly as I can for which I must very earnestly entreat reader&#39;s patience and attention: his patience in order to examine something which might appear unnecessarily tedious; his attention to understand what may, perhaps, after the fullest explication which I am capable of giving of it, appear still obscure. I am always willing to run some hazard of being tedious in order to be sure that I am perspicuous; and after taking the utmost pains that I can to be perspicuous, some obscurity may still appear to remain upon a subject in its own nature extremely abstracted.</description>

      <description>David Hume explained, in &amp;ldquo;National Characters&amp;rdquo;, that the natural environment of a society plays are role in its behavior. If a person were shaped by nature and nurture, then a society&amp;rsquo;s character is likewise shaped by its natural environment and the social cycles that nurture it.

      <description>David Hume&amp;rsquo;s Ideal Commonwealth shows a federalized plan of government unified under an executive senate and a representative legislature. It includes an election system that is based on votes from the representatives instead of popular votes.
In Lectures on Jurisprudence, Adam Smith shows the advantages of the Swiss voting system:
When there are 100 votes and three candidates A, B, and C, the most odious candidate might get elected. There might be 34 votes for A,and 33 for B, and 33 for C.</description>

      <description>Sextus Pompeius possessed Sicily and Sardinia, was master at sea, and saw himself at the head of a great multitude of fugitives, and persons devoted to death by proscriptions, whose last hopes depended on their valour. Octavius contended with him, in two very laborious wars; and after a variety of ill success, vanquished him by the abilities of Agrippa.
Most of the conspirators ended their lives in a miserable manner; and it was natural that persons who headed a party, so frequently harrassed by wars, in [88] which no quarter was afforded, should die a violent death.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the Emperors, from Caius Calicula to Antoninus</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.one/research/montesquieu/spirit-of-the-laws/book-29/chapter-15/</link>

      <description>CALICULA succeeded Tiberius, and it was said of him, that there never was a better slave, nor a worse master: and indeed these two circumstances are very consistent; for the same turn of mind which inclines a person to be strongly affected at unlimited power in his sovereign, makes him to be no less in love with it, when he rises to empire himself.
Caligula restored the assemblies of the people, which Tiberius had prohibited; and abolished the arbitrary law and constructions of treason established by that emperor: from which proceeding we may observe, that the beginnings of a bad reign sometimes resemble the conclusion of a good one; for a wicked prince may, from a principle of contradiction to the motives of his predecessor’s conduct, be spirited to actions which the other performed from a virtuous inducement; and we owe to this very principle a number of good as well as bad regulations.</description>

      <description>It was impossible for the republic to be re-established. There was no longer any tyrant, and yet liberty was extinguished because the causes of its destruction still continued to prevent its revival.
The assassins only had a plan of a conspiracy, but did not know how to make it effective. After the assassination, they all retired to the capital. The next day, Lepidus, who was fond of commotions, took the Forum with a band of soldiers.</description>

      <description>I will not discuss the horrors of the wars between Marius and Sylla. Appian has collected all the dreadful particulars into this history:
Both chiefs were jealous, ambitious, barbarous, and furious. The new citizens, and the ancient, no longer considered each other as members of the same republic, but gave a loose to a series of hostilities, so peculiar in their nature, as to comprehend all the miseries of a civil and foreign war.</description>

      <description>AS a river, sometimes, with a slow and silent progress, undermines the banks that have been thrown up to restrain its current, and at last overwhelms them in a moment, and sheds an inundation over the fields they formerly preserved; in the same manner, the supreme authority, which gained an insensible growth under Augustus, bore down all before it in the succeeding reign of Tiberius.
A law at that time subsisted, which made it treason to form any injurious attempt against the majesty of the people: Tiberius assumed to himself the interpretation and enforcement of this law, and extended it not only to the cases for which it was originally calculated, but to every conjuncture that could possibly be favourable to his hatred or suspicions.</description>

We build on Schumacher&amp;rsquo;s ideas and merge them with those of Adam Smith to create a multilateral free trade system which is based on gold or grains, as an implmentation of cross-border Pantrynomics.</description>

      <description>Many liberals advocate the self-regulation as an alternative to regulation by governments and institutions. They usually borrow passages from Adam Smith who said that the government should not lay its hand on the freedom of individuals to act as they see fit. They say that invisible hand of self-interest is much better at regulating the self:
Every individual works to render the society’s annual revenue as great as he can. He generally does not intend to promote the public interest.</description>

      <guid>https://superphysics.one/articles/supersociology/what-is-feudalism/</guid>
      <description>Feudalism is a way of controlling huge land areas where each land is divided into fiefs under a lord who is under a king, who is really the strongest lord. Thus, it can be viewed as a delegated way of governance. Forms of feudalism were practiced in Persia, India, and Turkey. The opposite of feudalism is the republican city-states of Greece and Rome.
Feudalism&amp;rsquo;s key characteristic is that the land stays with the nobility&amp;rsquo;s family forever and is not subdivided.</description>

      <description>From the time of Descartes to Kant, philosophy dominated the study of human knowledge in the West. It included metaphysics and was only countered by religion.
Science was then called Natural Philosophy which dealt with natural physical phenomena in line with metaphysical principles. For example, Newton&amp;rsquo;s Principia cited God as the source of nature&amp;rsquo;s movements.
But by the 19th century, the Europeans separated Natural Philosophy from Philosophy. It mutated into materialist science which was totally separate from metaphysics.</description>

 Our proposed science of pantrynomics is based on a new paradigm that sees individual entities as naturally part of a larger group of entities called a society.
Unlike normal definitions of society*, our definition describes a society* as a kind of metaphysical organism or mind that is made up of individual minds that agree to be part of that society.</description>

      <description>The Modern Economic Table is a flowchart invented by Francois Quesnay of the Physiocrats in the 18th century. It serves as a proof of how real wealth is generated from agriculture and mining or the productions of the earth instead of from manufacturing and services which merely add value.
Of course, this is not totally true. It is true that raw materials and agriculture are important, but it is also possible for services and processing to be just as important, or even more important.</description>

By fixing Einstein&amp;rsquo;s error, the speed of light no longer becomes a constant. Without this constant, the principles of motion no longer gets a linear speed limit. They can now extend onto the metaphysical dimension where motion manifests as the movement of minds and feelings which are never constant nor strictly linear by nature.</description>

The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge. Any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship. But he would never think that there is a true equal, true double, or true proportion in the spangled heavens.</description>

 reducing CO2 emissions through a carbon tax, anti-emission regulations, or green energy building infrastracture as new dams, roads, and bridges that can withstand natural disasters better  However, despite lobbying by various parties and governments, such solutions still are not implemented due to their cost or impracticality.</description>

      <description>The failure of quantitative easing, both in the US under Obama and in Japan as Abenomics, is proof that the operations of banking cannot directly and immediately lead to economic growth, as explained by Adam Smith:
The judicious operations of banking can increase a country’s industry, not by augmenting the country’s capital, but by rendering most of that capital productive.

      <description>The inelastic supply curve is the child-idea of the sophistry called the Equilibrium Theory of Economics. It manifests as a vertical line that says* that an essential, but hard-to-produce product can command whatever price its supplier wants.
 *Samuelson refers to it as the inelastic supply curve, while Case and Fair, and Roger Miller refer to it as the inelastic demand curve
 If the amount supplied is perfectly fixed, as in perishable fish for sale at whatever price, we face the perfectly inelastic supply.</description>

      <description>According to Socrates, all societies have alternating cycles that begin with democracy that switches to tyranny, then aristocracy, then oligarchy, and finally back to democracy.
 A democracy is dominated by working-class people. Its positive aspect is social justice, while its negative is chaos and mob rule. This chaos leads people to want order, paving the way for tyranny A tyranny is dominated by warriors, leaders, and generals. Its positive aspect is peace and order, while its negative is abuse and corruption.</description>

      <description>Our proposed Pool Clearing system, derived from EF Schumacher and Adam Smith, can prevent currency attack and commodity speculation since forward contracts will not be transferrable and private currency trading will not be allowed. This is because the clearing funds will do the work of providing liquidity and transferring working capital to the producers and exporters.
But how will the system work for overseas investments?
If a Japanese investor wants to invest his JPY 1b in Vietnam using the current financial system, he will convert it to USD which the Vietnamese banks will convert into VND.</description>

      <description>Pantrynomics will use Purchasing Power as its alternative to GDP, as explained in The Digression on the Value of Silver of the Wealth of Nations.
In that Digression, Adam Smith proved that money supply, as the prices of gold and silver, are not correlated with a society&amp;rsquo;s wealth or poverty. Instead, he wanted to prove that it is the money price of some rude produce relative to the main food grain (such as wheat), which is the clearest indicator of a society&amp;rsquo;s wealth or poverty.</description>

      <description>People sometimes use strange jargon like “red herring” or ‘Occam’s razor” when they try to disprove arguments that they don’t like. Such words then force the other side to do research on what those jargon mean. This can potentially waste a lot of time since there are a lot of fallacies. These fallacies were merely created by academics for the sake of creating something, just as mathematicians create paradoxes, and theoretical physicists create useless theories because thinking is part of their job.</description>

      <description>Summary: Businesses are based on money which really is just quantitative information, unable to carry qualitative information such as morality. Contracts on the other hand can carry such information and are a better foundation of sustainable business.
 In some societies, especially Eastern ones, business is usually looked down upon. In ancient China and Japan, merchants were not respected and were even oppressed.
In fact, both China and Japan closed off their doors to foreign trade.</description>

      <description>Japan launched Quantitative Easing (QE) as part of Abenomics which was announced in 2012, just as the US launched theirs after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Both actions failed to drive economic growth* for both countries and merely resulted in additional public debt.
 *The growth in the US really came from Trump&amp;rsquo;s fiscal reforms and trade war
 To explain why QE was used and why it failed, we need to go back to 1913.</description>

      <description>Japan has been suffering from chronic deflation since 1991 after the bursting of their asset price bubble. This is similar in pattern to the secular stagnation in the US after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Both problems persist because they have been given the wrong solutions in the form of &amp;ldquo;quantitative easing&amp;rdquo; (QE) in the US, and &amp;ldquo;Abenomics&amp;rdquo; in Japan.
What is Abenomics? Abenomics is a set of economic policies organized into three arrows:</description>

      <description>The advent of the internet allowed information to be shared globally, resulting in &amp;lsquo;information overload&amp;rsquo;. However, this increase in the quantity of information being perceived did not really come from new information, but instead came from already-existing information from various sources being made accessible to the user or perceiver.
Assuming that there are 100 million people in a country, and a person creates his own information and interacts with 100 people in a day, then he can perceive up to 100 units of information.</description>

      <description>A major turn-off in math is the use of arbitrary variables in equations, usually written in Greek characters. This burdens the mind which has to know what those variables mean just to make sense of of the whole equation. An error in one character will nullify the understanding of the whole equation and makes its output wrong.
To make math fun again, we can create a method called decon notation, which deconstructs those arbitrary Greek variables back into plain English.</description>

      <description>Viruses are not living organisms, but are merely bad idea-waves, manifesting as RNA-particles or code, which infect the code or DNA of actual living organisms. They expand exponentially, just like rumors and fashion trends, as long as there are many minds that are susceptible to fake news, rumors, and fashion. Fake news easily infects minds that have low resistance to information and are far from the truth, just as viruses easily infect those that put anything into their bodies, and are far from their natural state of health.</description>

      <description>Another flawed economic paradigm, aside from the Steady State Economy is the Resource Based Economy (RBE) by Jacque Fresco. It is implemented as The Venus Project which is a tech-urban master plan. This is a necessary consequence of Mr. Fresco being a designer by trade, as opposed to being a practicing scientist or civil engineer.
  Its most striking feature is that it aims to distribute goods and services without using:</description>

      <description>Last week, we were invited to join the SIS Online Hackathon, wherein the organizers were looking for a tech solution for B2B cash management. The Covid pandemic has wreaked havoc on cash and many customers are unable to pay their suppliers.
Fortunately, our proposed economic system, called The Pantry Hub, derived from Adam Smith, is purpose-built to predict and solve such problems. In fact, we have been warning of a huge global economic crisis as early as 2015.</description>

 Basic Universal Revenue (BUR) for creating basic value as food Resource Credits (RC) for keeping companies afloat and avoiding bankruptcy  Both BUR and RC have a common denominator which is their values are pegged to rice so that BUR is in ultimately in grams of rice just as RC is in kilos of rice or wheat.</description>

      <description>In 1772, a credit crisis originating in London hit and spread over Europe and affected the American colonies.
The cause was the creation and over-circulation of bounced checks then known as redrawn bills of exchange. Speculators used these bills to gamble with bank money and the deposits of other people. The end result was a loss of capital, creating a credit crunch, which led to an economic downturn hitting Europe and too-big-to-fail companies.</description>

      <description>This week, Minneapolis voted to replace its Police force with Community-based law enforcement. The reasoning is that their police force was abusive and ineffective.
However, from the nature of things, this is the wrong solution. If you had a personal chauffer (driver) who was reckless and has caused the deaths of others, you do not ban all chauffers and make people drive their own cars. Some people might suggest re-training the chauffers to make them more careful.</description>

      <description>The tech world was abuzz with the word artificial intelligence or AI in 2016 after Google released Tensorflow in late 2015.
AI is a big field which includes machine learning and data mining. Many startup companies market themselves as being AI-based. Most of the time, they just use a machine learning algorithm to produce different outputs which might not be useful.
What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with artificial? The problem is that intelligence is merely the ability to connect ideas.</description>

      <guid>https://superphysics.one/articles/superphysics/feelings-sentiments-emotions/</guid>
      <description>While simplifying Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s Theory of Moral Sentiments, I had to think a lot whether to change &amp;lsquo;sentiments&amp;rsquo; into &amp;lsquo;feelings&amp;rsquo; especially since the latter is nowadays more commonly used than the former.
Feelings vs Sentiments &amp;lsquo;Sentiment&amp;rsquo; is Latin for feeling.
&amp;lsquo;Feeling&amp;rsquo; is Old English for the ability of the heart to perceive, as opposed to:
 &amp;lsquo;sight&amp;rsquo;, the ability of the eye &amp;lsquo;think&amp;rsquo;, the ability of the brain &amp;lsquo;hearing&amp;rsquo;, the ability of the ear  Thus, &amp;lsquo;sentiment&amp;rsquo;, being Latin, is merely more formal and scientific than &amp;lsquo;feelings&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The Corona virus disease began in January in Wuhan, China just before the Lunar New Year. At that time, it bore all the signs of SARS and so the world was not so alarmed, as China and Hongkong already had experience with such an epidemic.
This all changed from February 20 when it spread into Iran and Italy. By March 11, the World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic. As of May 26, or 5 months in, there have been 5.</description>

      <description>Hume was very much against shallow, unenlightened philosophers who wrote a lot of nonsense.
Kant is one such philosopher.
Hume already said that there was no such thing as a priori knowledge, but Kant refuted this by saying some were a priori. In reality, Kant was referring to belief and not knowledge.
Major Difference 1: A Priori; Belief Versus Knowledge There are a priori beliefs that you do not know where it came from (like why Person 1 likes chocolate instead of crisps, but Person 2 likes crisps instead of chocolate)</description>

      <description>Summary: The effort theory of value is the foundation of Pantrynomics and is derived entirely from Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s wheat-based valuation in the Wealth of Nations Book 1 Chapter 5. Instead of pegging value to metal coins, it pegs it to the abstract difficulty, stress, or hardship of a task to produce a product or service, which is then relativistically pegged to food, through basic universal revenue and the Economic Table of the Physiocrats</description>

      <description>People have loved money ever since it was invented. The philosophers David Hume and Socrates, on the other hand, were not so keen on money because of its drawbacks.
Money builds ego Having a lot of money gives theego power over other egos, giving a feeling of superiority to the monied-ego, leading to arbitrary actions which encroaches on other egos, creatinginjusticeand eventually,evil.
A dirt-poor evil bum can hurt a few people, but an ultra rich evil man can hurt so many.</description>

      <guid>https://superphysics.one/pantrynomics/basic-universal-revenue/</guid>
      <description>Pantrynomics introduces the concept of resourcization or the use of resource credits which are social contracts that give right to assets or resources (products and services) in lieu of money.
The credits allow the unsold productivity of a slowing-down economy to be stored to avoid a crash, just as monetization does the opposite and speeds up an economy by converting productivity into money via sales.
Resource credits are implemented generally through Basic Universal Revenue that will give nonmonetary rewards (as food) to productive people.</description>

      <description>Our proposed moral system, derived from Adam Smith, David Hume, and Socrates, is based on a clear definition of morality as happiness for the most entities possible for the longest time possible.
The &amp;ldquo;most entities possible&amp;rdquo; encompasses moral space, while &amp;ldquo;for the longest time possible&amp;rdquo; encompasses moral time. The end goal of maximizing moral space and time, by specifying &amp;ldquo;most&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;longest&amp;rdquo;, is the attainment of the state of peace. This ultimate state then answers the purpose of creation and closes the loop of existence.</description>

      <description>The consumption or demand motive is one of the most important maxims of Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s economic system, aside from the Effort Theory of Value. This maxim states that all economic activity is rooted in the people or the demanders in society and not in the producers or suppliers*. This is easily seen in the concept of the human family which is the smallest and most common type of society. We see parents work to provide or produce food for their children who are their consumers.</description>

      <description>Introduction 1 Political economy, as a science of a legislator, proposes:
 To provide a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people by enabling them to provide it for themselves To supply the state with a revenue for the public services  It proposes to enrich both the people and the sovereign.

 The system of commerce &amp;ndash; This is the modern system best understood in our own country and in our own times The system of agriculture  Chapter 1: The Principle of the Commercial or Mercantile System 1 The popular notion that wealth consists in metal money or in gold and silver naturally arises from the double function of money as:</description>

      <description>12 The amount of commodities human industry can buy or produce is naturally regulated by the effective demand in every country.
The effective demand the demand of the people who are willing to pay the rent, labour, and profits needed to make them and bring them to market.
Gold and silver are the commodities which best regulate themselves most exactly to this effective demand. They are most easily transported from where they are cheap, to where they are dear.</description>

      <description>The principal cause for the disuse of the Salic and Roman laws, and the Capitularies was the great extent given to judiciary combats.
The Salic laws did not admit of this custom and so they became useless and fell into oblivion. The Roman laws also rejected this custom. Their whole attention was then taken up in establishing the law of judicial combats, and in forming a proper digest of the several cases that might happen on those occasions.</description>

When the Christian religion, two centuries ago, became unhappily divided into Catholic and Protestant, the people of the North embraced the Protestant, and those of the south adhered still to the Catholic.</description>

      <description>A PRINCE who undertakes to destroy or to change the established religion of his kingdom, must greatly expose himself. If his government is despotic, he runs a much greater risk of seeing a revolution arise from such a proceeding, than from any tyranny whatsoever, and a revolution is not an uncommon thing in such states. The reason of this is, because a state cannot change its religion, manners and customs, in an instant, and with the same rapidity as the prince publishes the ordinance which establishes a new religion.</description>

      <description>Moscow would have descended from its despotic power, but could not.
The establishment of commerce depended on that of the exchange, and the transactions were inconsistent with all its laws.
In 1745, the Czarina made a law to expel the Jews, because they remitted overseas the coin of those who were banished into Siberia, as well as the coin of the foreigners in her service.
All the subjects of the empire are slaves.</description>

 rest the honour, fortune, and life of the subject, on things that depended less on reason than on hazard, and incessantly make use of proofs incapable of convicting, and that had no manner of connexion either with innocence or guilt.

      <description>SOME have imagined, that it was for the advantage of a state to be indebted to itself: they thought that this multiplied riches, by increasing the circulation.
Those who are of this opinion have, I believe, confounded a circulating paper which represents money, or a circulating paper which is the sign of the profits that a company has, or will make by commerce, with a paper which represents a debt. The two first are extremely advantageous to the state: the last can never be so: and all that we can expect from it is, that individuals have a good security from the government for their money.</description>

      <description>We can infer from Agobard’s letter to Lewis the Debonnaire that the custom of judicial combats was not established among the Franks. After having represented to that prince the abuses of the law of Gundebald, he desires* that private disputes should be decided in Burgundy by the law of the Franks.
But the trial by combat at that time in France has been the cause of some perplexity. The law of the Salian Franks did not allow of this kind of trial but the Ripuarian Franks did.</description>

      <description>SOME perhaps will have a curiosity to see this abominable custom of judiciary combat reduced to principle, and to find a code of such extraordinary laws.
Men, though reasonable in the main, reduce their very prejudices to rule. Nothing was more contrary to good sense, than those combats: Yet when once this point was laid down, a kind of prudential management was used in carrying it into execution.
In order to be thoroughly acquainted with the jurisprudence of those times, it is necessary to read with attention the regulations of St.</description>

      <description>WHEN pledges of battle had been received upon a civil affair of small importance, the lord obliged the parties to withdraw them.
If a fact was notorious;* for instance, if a man had been assassinated in the open market-place, then there was neither a trial by witnesses, nor by combat; the judge gave his decision from the notoriety of the fact.
When the court of a lord had often determined after the same manner, and the usage was thus known,† the lord refused to grant the parties the privilege of duelling, to the end that the usages might not be altered by the different success of the combats.</description>

      <description>THERE is both real and ideal money.
Civilized nations generally only use ideal money, because they have converted their real money into ideal.
Their real money was initially some metal of a certain weight and standard. But soon dishonesty or lack made them reduce that metal from money, but money retained the same name.
For example, they removed a half of the silver from a livre at a pound weight, but still called it a livre.</description>

      <description>But how comes it, some will say, that when the institutions were laid aside,
The judicial forms of the canon law were preferred to those of the Roman law because they had constantly before them the ecclesiastic courts, which followed the forms of the canon law.
They knew of no court that followed those of the Roman law. Besides, the limits of the spiritual and temporal jurisdiction were then very little understood.</description>

      <description>THE civil power was in the hands of an infinite number of lords. This made it easy for the ecclesiastic jurisdiction to gain daily a greater extent.
But as the ecclesiastic courts weakened those of the lords, and contributed thereby to give strength to the royal jurisdiction, the latter gradually checked the jurisdiction of the clergy.
The parliament, which in its form of proceedings had adopted whatever was good and useful in the spiritual courts, soon perceived nothing else but the abuses which had crept into those tribunals.</description>

      <description>THE judges, who had no other rule to go by than the usages, inquired very often by witnesses into every cause that was brought before them.
The usage of judicial combats beginning to decline, they made their inquests in writing.
But a verbal proof committed to writing, is never more than a verbal proof; so that this only increased the expences of law proceedings. Regulations were then made which rendered most of those inquests useless; public registers were established, which ascertained most facts, as nobility, age, legitimacy and marriage.</description>

      <description>FRANCE was governed by written customs. The particular usages of each lordship constituted the civil law.
Every lordship had its civil law, according to Beaumanoir, and so particular a law, that this author who is looked upon as a luminary, and a very great luminary, of those times, says, he does not believe that throughout the whole kingdom there were two lordships intirely governed by the same law.
This prodigious diversity had a two-fold origin.</description>

Soon, the commerce of Europe almost entirely lost. The nobility, who had every where the direction of affairs, were in no pain about it.
The laws of the Visigoths permitted private people to occupy half the beds of great rivers, provided the other half remained free for nets and boats.</description>

The law of the Ripuarian Franks was quite different as it allowed negative proofs. The accused could clear himself by swearing among witnesses that he had not committed the crime. The number of witnesses increased in proportion to the importance of the affair. Sometimes it amounted to 72.</description>

Fiefs became hereditary and arriere-fiefs extended. Many usages were introduced which made these laws obsolete. Disputes were still regulated by fines. But the value of money changed and so the fines were also changed.
France was divided into petty lordships, which acknowledged feudal dependence which made it very difficult for only one law to be authorised. Officers could no longer be sent into the provinces to inspect the administration of justice and political affairs.</description>

      <description>ON the other hand, religion may support a state, when the laws themselves are incapable of doing it.
Thus, when a kingdom is frequently agitated by civil wars, religion may do much, by obliging one part of the state to remain always quiet. Among the Greeks, the Eleans, as priests of Apollo, lived always in peace.
In Japan*, the city of Meaco enjoys a constant peace, as being a holy city: religion supports this regulation, and that empire which seems to be alone upon earth, and which neither has, nor will have, any dependence on foreigners, has always, in its own bosom, a trade which war cannot ruin.</description>

      <description>The law of the Lombards was impartial. The Romans were under no temptation to quit their own for it.
The motive which prevailed with the Romans under the Franks to make choice of the Salic law, did not take place in Italy; hence the Roman law maintained itself there, together with that of the Lombards.
It even fell out, that the latter gave way to the Roman institutes, and ceased to be the law of the ruling nation; and though it continued to be that of the principal nobility, yet the greatest part of the cities formed themselves into republics, and the nobility mouldered away of themselves, or were destroyed.</description>

The men who remain may preserve the spirit of industry; they may seek to repair their misfortunes, and calamity itself may make them become more industrious. This evil is almost incurable, when the depopulation is prepared before-hand by interior vice and a bad government. When this is the case, men perish with an insensible and habitual disease: born in misery and weakness, in violence, or under the influence of a wicked administration, they see themselves destroyed, and frequently without perceiving the cause of their destruction.</description>

If the infants were deformed and monstrous, he permitted the exposing them, after having shewn them to five of their nearest neighbours.
Romulus did not suffer† them to kill any infants under three years old: by which means he reconciled the law that gave to fathers the right over their children of life and death, with that which prohibited their being exposed.</description>

Appeals were strange to a warlike nation entirely governed by honour. An appeal among the Franks was a challenge to fight with arms, a challenge decided by blood, and not by an invitation to a paper quarrel.</description>

All the difference is, that other things may be either hired or bought; whilst money, which is the price of things, can only be hired, and not bought.*
To lend money without interest, is certainly an action laudable and extremely good; but it is obvious, that it is only a counsel of religion, and not a civil law.</description>

Beaumanoir says:
“If the party leaves the court without appealing he loses his appeal, and the judgment stands good.” This continued still in force, even after all the restrictions of judicial combat.  THE villain could not bring an appeal of false judgment against the court of his lord. This we learn from Défontaines, and is confirmed moreover by the institutions.</description>

      <description>WE meet with inexplicable enigmas in the codes of the laws of the Barbarians.
The law of the Frisians allows only half a sou in composition to a person that had been beaten with a stick; Yet for ever so small a wound it allows more. By the Salic law, if a freeman gave three blows with a stick to another freeman, he paid three sous; if he drew blood, he was punished as if he had wounded him with steel, and he paid fifteen sous: thus the punishment was proportioned to the greatness of the wound.</description>

      <description>WHEN the German nations subdued the Roman empire, they learned to write so they imitated the Romans and wrote down their own usages and digested them into codes.
The reign of Charlemagne was followed by:
 unhappy reigns the Norman invasions, and the civil wars.  These plunged the conquering nations again into the darkness and caused reading and writing to be neglected. These led to the written laws of the Barbarians, the Roman law, and the capitularies to fall into oblivion in France and Germany.</description>

      <description>Population policy depend greatly on circumstances. There are countries, in which nature does all.
There is no need to encourage propagation when a fruitful climate yields enough people. Sometimes, the climate is more favourable than the soil. The people multiply, and are destroyed by famine.
This is the case of China. Hence a father sells his daughters, and exposes his children. In Tonkin, the same causes produce the same effects. so we need not, like the Arabian travellers mentioned by Renaudot, search for the origin of this in their sentiments on the metempsychosis.</description>

      <description>THE first men, says Porphyry, sacrificed only vegetables. In a worship so simple, every one might be priest in his own family.
The natural desire of pleasing the Deity multiplied ceremonies. From hence it followed, that men employed in agriculture became incapable of observing them all, and of filling up the number.
Particular places were consecrated to the gods; it then became necessary that they should have ministers to take care of them; in the same manner as every citizen took care of his house and domestic affairs.</description>

If they could not agree, the person before whom the action was brought, appointed one of them to prosecute the quarrel.  When a gentleman challenged a villain, he was obliged to present himself on foot with buckler and baston;
But if he came on horseback, and armed like a gentleman, they took his horse and his arms from him; and stripping him to his shirt, they compelled him to fight in that condition with the villain.</description>

      <description>THE appeal of default of justice was when the court of a particular lord deferred, evaded, or refused to do justice to the parties.
During the time of our princes of the second race, though the count had several offices under him, their person was subordinate, but not their jurisdiction. These officers in their court-days, assizes, or placita, gave judgment in the last resort as the count himself; all the difference consisted in the division of the jurisdiction.</description>

The weakness of the people and the tyranny of their laws united this immense body. The Roman policy was then to avoid all communication with those nations whom they had not subdued.

      <description>GARCILASSO informs us, that in Spain after the conquest of the Indies, interest fell from 10% to 5%.
The cause is that conquest bringing in a lot of money suddenly into Europe. Many persons got money and had a need for it. The price of all things increased, while the value of money diminished. The proportion was then broken, and all the old debts were discharged.
We may recollect the time of the system when every thing was at a high price except specie.</description>

      <description>The following people trade by exchange:
 savages who have few merchandise civilized nations who have only two or three species.  The caravans of Moors who go to Timbuktu, in the heart of Africa, do not need money.
They exchange their salt for gold. The Moor puts his salt in a heap. The Negro puts his gold dust in another. If there is not gold enough, the Moor takes away some of his salt, or the Negro adds more gold, until both parties are agreed.</description>

      <description>Comic writers exaggerate every character. This moral kind of painting for the stage has been often compared to the painting for cupolas and cielings, where the colours are over-charged, and every part is drawn excessively large, and beyond nature. The figures seem monstrous and disproportioned, when seen too nigh;
but become natural and regular, when set at a distance, and placed in that point of view, in which they are intended to be surveyed.</description>

 the best suited to their sex and education much more instructive than their ordinary books of amusement more entertaining than those serious compositions in their closets  History can teach them two important truths that can give them peace:
 Both sexes are far from being such perfect creatures The male-world is not only governed by love, but is often overcome by avarice, ambition, vanity, and a thousand other passions.</description>

      <description>Why do women complain so much about everything that goes wrong in a marriage? Do they mean, that they are the parties principally concerned, and that if a backwardness to enter into that state should prevail in the world, they would be the greatest sufferers?
Or, are they sensible, that the misfortunes and miscarriages of the married state are owing more to their sex than to ours?
I hope they do not intend to confess either of these two particulars, or to give such an advantage to their adversaries, the men, as even to allow them to suspect it.</description>

      <description>The common complaints against Providence are ill-grounded.
Good or bad fortune is caused by the good or bad qualities of people. There are many instances to the contrary. But these are few, relative to the actual distribution of prosperity and adversity and to the common course of human affairs.
We will get love and esteem if we have benevolence and love. This is the chief circumstance in life. It facilitates every enterprize and undertaking besides the satisfaction, which immediately results from it.</description>

They rail against Reason, Sobriety, Honour, Friendship, Marriage perpetually. They even regard public spirit and nationalism as fake.
If the schemes of these anti-reformers were to be implemented, the bonds of society will break. and make way for licentious mirth and gaiety.
 Drunken frollics would be preferred to friendship. Dissolute prodigality would drain away every valuable thing.</description>

      <description>Upon comparing the whole, it is impossible why the world should have been more populous in ancient than in modern times.
The equality of property among the ancients, liberty, and the small divisions of their states, were favourable to their population growth. But:
 their wars were more bloody and destructive, their governments more factious and unsettled, commerce and manufactures more feeble and languishing, and the general police more loose and irregular.</description>

      <description>Ancient Housing Halicarnassæus says that:
The ancient walls of Rome were nearly of the same compass with those of Athens, but that the suburbs ran out to a great extent. It was difficult to tell, where the town ended or the country began.  Halicarnassæus, Juvenal, and other ancient writers say that the Roman houses were high and families lived in separate storeys, one above another.
But these were probably only the poorer citizens in a few streets.</description>

The more I look into this, the more I doubt the great populousness of the ancient times.
Plato says:
Athens was the greatest of all the Greek cities, except Syracuse, which was nearly about the same size in Thucydides’s time, and afterwards encreased beyond it.  Cicero mentions Athens as the greatest of all the Greek cities in his time, excluding Antioch or Alexandria.</description>

      <description>The previous post explained the concept of Qosts or the quantum of space time. These are points in spacetime that gather energy to create mass in order to create discrete things. These create spacetime by their mutual repulsion and, thus, are essential in levitation and teleportation.
  These can also be employed to harness energy, as opposed to creating it, in two ways:
  By tapping into the repulsion of qosts that lead to the accelerated expansion of space.</description>

      <description>The spacetime layer is the second layer of the Greek five layer model. It manifests as the space, size, and age of the universe. It gives the ideas and energies from the aethereal layer a chance to cross over onto physical reality via gravitation.
The creation of gravitational nodes leads to the mutual repulsion between nodes, leading to the perception of space and time.
In terms of creation, this is the second layer that processes ideas into possible energies and matter.</description>

Any degree of it may be innocent or blameable, according to the age, country, or condition of the person. Its virtue and vice cannot here be exactly fixed, more than in other moral subjects.

      <description>Marriage is an engagement entered into by mutual consent for the propagation of the species. It is susceptible of all the conditions, which consent establishes, provided they be not contrary to this end.
A man, in conjoining himself to a woman, is bound to her according to the terms of his engagement.
In begetting children, he is bound, by all the ties of nature and humanity, to provide for their subsistence and education.</description>

      <description>Monarchies get their foundation from a superstitious reverence to priests and princes who have commonly abridged the liberty of reasoning on religion, and politics, and consequently metaphysics and morals. All these form the most considerable branches of science. Mathematics and natural philosophy, which only remain, are not half so valuable.
Among the arts of conversation, no one pleases more than mutual deference or civility, which leads us to resign our own inclinations to those of our companion, and to curb and conceal that presumption and arrogance, so natural to the human mind.</description>

      <description>The revolutions and periods in human history are full of variety and surprize in the manners, customs, and opinions.
Civil history has more uniformity than the history of learning and science. The wars, negotiations, and politics of one age resemble more those of another, than the taste, wit, and speculative principles.
Interest and ambition, honour and shame, friendship and enmity, gratitude and revenge, are the prime movers in all public transactions.</description>

      <description>Political writers who are free from party-prejudices cultivate a science that contributes most to public utility, of all sciences. They get a private satisfaction from it. However, I suspect that the world is still too young to establish many general universal truths in politics.
We still have not experienced 3,000 years and so the art of reasoning is still imperfect in this science, as in all others. We even lack sufficient materials to reason on.</description>

      <description>It is wrong to say that all governments are alike, and that their only difference is in the character and conduct of the governors. If this were true, then most political disputes would end and there would be just one constitution for all. I condemn the idea that human affairs are merely caused by the casual humours and characters of particular men.
The goodness of all government is in the goodness of the administration.</description>

      <description>Is the idea of the balance of power created by modern policy? Or is it a new invention?
Xenophon&amp;rsquo;s Institution of Cyrus writes about the combination of the Asiatic powers from a jealousy of the encreasing force of the Medes and Persians. This proves that the balance of power was a prevailing notion in the ancient times.
This balance is in the anxiety of Greek politics. Thucydides writes that the league formed against Athens leading to the Peloponnesian war was caused by this principle.</description>

 the ease with which the many are governed by the few. the implicit submission of men to their rulers.  What causes this?
We see:
 that the subjects always have the force to overturn their leader is always on the that the public opinion is the only thing that supports their leaders  Thus, government is founded only on opinion.

Are Humans Inherently Divine or Evil? The most remarkable are those founded on the feelings on the dignity of human nature. This has divided philosophers, poets, and divines of the past to the present. Some exalt our species.</description>

These two kinds of false religion are both pernicious, yet very different and even contrary. Human minds are subject to many terrors and apprehensions coming from:
 the unhappy situation of affairs, ill health, a gloomy and melancholy disposition, or the concurrence of all these circumstances.</description>

gotten on one side from astronomy and on the other side from harmonics that, taken in every which way,
harmonic ratios hold between these 12 termini or movements of the six planets revolving around the sun or that they approximate such ratios within an imperceptible part of least concord.
In Book 3, Chapter 1, we first built up the single harmonic consonances separately, and then joined together all the consonances—as many as there were—in one common system or musical scale, or, rather, in one octave of them which embraces the rest in power.</description>

      <description>This kinship [cognatio] is various and manifold, but there are 4 degrees of it.
For either the sign of kinship is taken from the outward form alone which the figures have, or else ratios which are the same as the harmonic arise in the construction of the side, or result from the figures already constructed, taken simply or together; or, lastly, they are either equal to or approximate the ratios of the spheres of the figure.</description>

      <description>In Superphysics, physical existence is made when the aether arbitrarily creates quanta of spacetime or qost*, which are 1-dimensional points, within itself. Each point is a discrete and unique identity filled with an arbitrary amount of qualities as potentiality. These identities push each other to preserve their identity while innumerable qosts are created. The pushing leads to the creation and expansion of physical space, first as 2-dimensional and then into 3-dimensions.</description>

      <description>We all know that physical reality exists inside space and time. But how were space and time created?
According to Physics, it was created through a Big Bang which started out as a Singularity that created matter and energy from nothing. So what is the nature of this Singularity? No one is able to answer this.
Superphysics answers that the whole Big Bang paradigm is flawed in the first place because material creation did not originate from a material cause.</description>

      <description>The question &amp;lsquo;Does God exist?&amp;rsquo; can be answered by &amp;lsquo;Can you perceive Existence?&amp;rsquo;.
Earlier, we said that:
 every physical perception has a metaphysical idea-equivalent each idea produces an opposite idea: beauty has ugliness, health has disease a mind is an arena to experience such perceptions and ideas  So where does our idea of God come from?
The human mind naturally creates the idea of God to have an extremely positive counterweight to extremely negative perceptions such as typhoons, life, death, wealth, goodness, evil, etc.</description>

      <description>Physics is based on a materialistic interpretation of reality, which is opposite of the metaphysical interpretation by Superphysics.
For example, physics prefers to view things as particles. This is consistent with the atomic model of Democritus and opposite of the musical model of Pythagoras.
 The atomic model was embraced by Newton and Einstein The musical model was embraced by Socrates and Kepler  We continue this musical paradigm by using waves instead of particles.</description>

The purpose of ideas is to create experience. However, experience can only exist if there is an experiencer. Thus, there are only two things in this &amp;lsquo;matrix&amp;rsquo; of Existence:
 the experiencer the experience of ideas and feelings  Before existence began, the Absolute Creator had nothing to create those experiencer and experiences.</description>

      <description>Light, as analog waves, carry more data as &amp;ldquo;R-O-Y-G-B-I-V&amp;rdquo; than electrons that can only carry digital binary data as &amp;ldquo;ON-OFF&amp;rdquo; at a time. This analog light data can then be absorbed by glass or semiconductor crystals to be processed by normal computer logic.
This principle was recently proven to be realizable in Germany. In their experiment, intense light pulses of waves ranging from near-infrared to visible orange were used to generate oscillating currents in a chip made with gallium arsenide.</description>

      <description>The extreme liberty that we enjoy in Britain surprises foreigners the most.
We can say whatever we want to the public and openly censure every measure by the king or his ministers. If the administration resolves to go to war, they either wilfully or ignorantly mistake the interests of the nation.
Peace, in the present situation, is infinitely preferable. If our ministers prefer peace, our political writers breathe nothing but war and devastation.</description>

      <description>Superphysics arose from Juan&amp;rsquo;s personal research on the 2008 Financial Crisis which led to the 2008 Food Crisis, 2011 Arab Spring, and the Eurozone crisis.
The 2008 Financial Crisis arose from Allan Greenspan not doing his job of regulating the banking industry, citing Adam Smith who advocated non-regulation. So Adam Smith should be such an evil guy for causing so much trouble, right?
By going through Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s works, we saw that he actually advocated the strict regulation of banking, comparing it to the building of firewalls to prevent the spread of fire.</description>

      <description>Confucius alluded to the head of the Ki family, and the eight lines of posturers before their ancestral hall.
Confucius: If the Ki can allow himself to go to this extent, to what extent will he not allow himself to go?
The Three Families were in the habit, during the Removal of the sacred vessels after sacrifice, of using the hymn commencing, Harmoniously the Princes draw near with reverent tread, assisting in his worship Heaven&#39;s Son, the great and dread.</description>

      <description>Part 1 The most philosophical reasonings have been on proving the existence of a Deity, and refute the fallacies of Atheists.
Yet most religious philosophers still dispute whether anyone can be so blinded as to be a speculative atheist. How shall we reconcile these contradictions? The knights-errant wandered about to clear the world of dragons and giants. They believed in them. The skeptic is another enemy of religion.
He naturally provokes the indignation of all divines and graver philosophers.</description>

      <description>1 The advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of labour and stock must be perfectly equal or continually tending to equality in the same neighbourhood.
If there was advantageous employment, so many people would crowd into it in the one case, and so many would desert it in the other, that its advantages would soon be at level with other employments. This would happen where:
 there was perfect liberty things were left to follow their natural course everyone was free to choose and change their occupation as they saw fit.</description>

      <description>PROFESSOR PIGOU makes the volume of employment to depend on two factors:
  The real rates of wages for which workpeople stipulate
  The shape of the Real Demand Function for Labour
  His work determines the shape of the latter function.
The fact that workpeople in fact stipulate, not for a real rate of wages, but for a money-rate, is not ignored; but, in effect, it is assumed that the actual money-rate of wages divided by the price of wage-goods can be taken to measure the real rate demanded.</description>

      <description>There is a connection between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in their appearance to the memory or imagination
They introduce each other with a certain degree of method and regularity. In our more serious thinking or discourse this is so observable that any particular thought, which breaks in upon the regular tract or chain of ideas, is immediately remarked and rejected. Even in our wildest and most wandering reveries, nay in our very dreams, we shall find, if we reflect, that the imagination ran not altogether at adventures, but that there was still a connexion upheld among the different ideas, which succeeded each other.</description>

Capitals neither increase nor decrease when revenues match expenses. Some modes of expence contribute more to the growth of public opulence than others.
38 The person&amp;rsquo;s revenue may be spent in either:
 non-durable things which are consumed immediately, or The revenue spent this way daily can neither alleviate nor support the next day&amp;rsquo;s expence. durable things which can be accumulated.</description>

The design was generous but the execution was imprudent. It did not understand the nature and causes of the distress it meant to relieve. This bank was more liberal in granting cash accounts and in discounting bills of exchange than any other bank. It discounted all bills equally, including real and circulating bills.</description>

      <description>79 The Bank of England is the biggest bank of circulation in Europe.
It was incorporated by a charter under the Great Seal on July 27, 1694. It then lent to government £1.2 million in exchange for an annuity of £100,000 composed of:
 £96,000 interest or 8% [1.2m * 0.08], and £4,000 annually for management expenses.  The Glorious Revolution established a new government which had a very low credit because it was obliged to borrow at so high an interest.</description>

      <description>A quasi-contract is founded on the duty of restitution.
If you find a watch, you should give it back by the right of property, because a man does not lose property with possession. But if you and I balance accounts, and you pay me but you afterwards find that you did not owe that sum, how will you claim it? You cannot ask for it because you alienated that sum. You cannot claim it by contract, for there never was one made between us.</description>

 materials to work on, tools to work with, and wages or recompense for the work done.  Money is neither a material to work on, nor a tool to work with.</description>

In most manufactures, a journeyman may be sure of employment almost every day. A mason or bricklayer, on the contrary, cannot work in bad weather.

      <description>In Book 1 of A Treatise of Human Nature, David Hume laid out his principle of the self.
According to him, &amp;lsquo;identity&amp;rsquo; is a perception of something that is separate from another perception. For example, the identity of a car&amp;rsquo;s tire is a separate identity from the car because our minds can perceive them as separately existing.
If our minds cannot separate them, then their identity is one. An example is the balloon of a hot air balloon which cannot be separated without destroying its vehicle&amp;rsquo;s identity.</description>

      <description>The nation&amp;rsquo;s money can be commonly altered in three ways:
 When the value of the coins are altered When the weight of the coins are altered, yet retain their former rates When the standard is debased or enriched in the fineness of the gold and silver, yet the money continues in their former values.  We always see people trying to supply the want for money, while keeping its plenty.</description>

      <description>The Uniqueness of Each Incarnation Each Soul extends portions of itself into time &amp;amp; space as particular incarnations. Just as many fingers extend out from the same one hand, there are many incarnations at many points in time and space, all emanating from the same Soul.
From the point of view of your Soul (outside time &amp;amp; space) all these incarnations (past incarnations, present incarnation, future incarnations) are all simultaneously occurring NOW.</description>

      <description>Moral philosophy is the science of human nature.
It can be treated in two ways. Each way has its own merit and can contribute to the entertainment, instruction, and reformation of mankind:
  One way treats humans chiefly as born for action.   Humans are influenced by taste and feelings. They pursue some objects and avoid others, depending on the value of those objects as they present themselves.</description>

      <description>The Master pronounced Kung-ye Ch&amp;rsquo;ang, a disciple, to be a marriageable person; for although lying bound in criminal fetters he had committed no crime. And he gave him his own daughter to wife.
Of Nan Yung, a disciple, he observed, that in a State where the government was well conducted he would not be passed over in its appointments, and in one where the government was ill conducted he would evade punishment and disgrace.</description>

      <description>Cash Accounts 44 Scotland’s commerce is not very great at present. It was smaller when the first two banks were established. Those banks would have had little trade had they confined their business to discounting of bills of exchange.
They invented cash accounts &amp;ndash; another method of issuing their promissory notes.
 They give credit (£2,000-3,000 for example) to anyone who could procure two persons of undoubted credit and good landed estate to become surety for him.</description>

      <description>All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact. Of the first kind are the sciences of Geometry, Algebra, and Arithmetic; and in short, every affirmation which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain. That the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the square of the two sides, is a proposition which expresses a relation between these figures.</description>

      <description>65 It is now more than 25 years since the paper money issued by the Scottish banks was more than fully equal to what the national circulation could easily absorb and employ.
Those banks gave more than all the assistance possible to Scottish traders and entrepreneurs. The traders and entrepreneurs had overtraded a little. They brought themselves either a loss or a profit reduction which always results from the smallest degree of overtrading.</description>

      <description>Have you wondered why negative ions make us feel positive, and positive ions make us feel negative?
That&amp;rsquo;s because electrons are really positively charged! Benjamin Franklin made a mistake when he called electrons as negative. Rather than confuse everyone by calling the negative as positive, we&amp;rsquo;d rather call the negative as &amp;lsquo;feminine charge&amp;rsquo;, the positive as a &amp;lsquo;masculine charge&amp;rsquo;, and neutral as a &amp;lsquo;bisexual charge&amp;rsquo;.
The attraction between protons, electrons, and neutrons intuitively follow this naming convention, just as Shiva is male and Shakti is female.</description>

      <description>1 The destiny of all capitals is to maintain productive labour.
But the amount of that labour varies extremely according to:
 the diversity of their employment and the value it adds to the national annual produce.  2 A capital may be employed in four ways:
 In procuring the rude produce required for society&amp;rsquo;s use and consumption   Examples are the capitals used in improving or cultivating lands, mines, or fisheries  In manufacturing and preparing that rude produce for immediate use and consumption   Examples are the capitals of all master manufacturers  In transporting the rude or manufactured produce from where they abound to where they are wanted   Examples are the capitals of all wholesale merchants  In dividing portions of rude or manufactured produce into small parcels for those who want them.</description>

      <description>ALL production is for the purpose of ultimately satisfying a consumer. Time usually elapses, however — and sometimes much time — between the incurring of costs by the producer (with the consumer in view) and the purchase of the output by the ultimate consumer. Meanwhile the entrepreneur (including both the producer and the investor in this description) has to form the best expectations[1] he can as to what the consumers will be prepared to pay when he is ready to supply them (directly or indirectly) after the elapse of what may be a lengthy period; and he has no choice but to be guided by these expectations, if he is to produce at all by processes which occupy time.</description>

      <description>Money supply makes all things dear or cheap. This money is either gotten or lost in foreign trade by the over or under-balancing of foreign trade.
If we melt down our gold into coin, it would create a lot of money for a time. But we would not be richer. This money will be sent overseas if we:
 buy too many foreign goods, or maintain a war where we supply our armies with foreign goods bought with our money.</description>

  Testamentary   In testamentary succession, the distribution of goods is done according to the will of the deceased.
 Legal   In legal succession, the law distributes the goods of the deceased to those whom the deceased is presumed to have chosen, according to some lawyers. But this supposes that testamentary succession came before legal succession, which is contrary to experience.
In a rude period, a man rarely had the full property of his goods during his lifetime.</description>

The high duties on foreign wheat amount to a ban in times of moderate plenty. These duties, with the ban on the importation of foreign cattle and salt, are not so advantageous to British graziers and farmers as other bans are to British merchants and manufacturers. Manufactures, especially those of the finer kind, can be more easily transported than wheat or cattle.</description>

If a Prince has £2,000,000 yearly revenue, and spend but £1, why should he not spend the other?
The affairs of Princes is far different from normal people. A King&amp;rsquo;s revenue is very great, yet if the Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s gain is small, this gain must ever give rule and proportion to that Treasure, which may conveniently be laid up yearly,
If he amasses more money than is gained by the over-balance of his foreign trade, he shall ruin his Subjects.</description>

      <description>The Revenues of Princes depend on their riches and on the trade of their respective dominions. These depend on the constitution of the Countreys, the government, laws, and customs of the people. The Prince can only alter these with much difficulty and danger.
 Some Kings have their Crown Lands, Church lands, Customs, Tolls and Imposts on all imports and exports, Loans, Donations and Subsidies. Other States omit the last three and focus on the former as sales taxes and fees on the marriage money of women, licence mony upon all Victualling houses and Inkeepers, head mony, Custom upon all Corn, Wine, Oyl, Salt and the like.</description>

The ordinary means therefore to encrease our wealth is by Forraign Trade wherein we must ever observe this rule: to sell more than we buy of theirs in value.
If we sell our excess worth £2,200,000 pounds to foreign countriess and buy foreign goods worth £2,000,000 pounds, we will get richer by £200,000 in money because the part of our stock not returned to us in goods must necessarily return in money.</description>

      <description>Book 18: Good Men in Seclusion (under construction)
Confucius: In the reign of the last king of the Yin dynasty,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;ldquo;there were three men of philanthropic spirit:�the viscount of Wei, who withdrew from him; the viscount of Ki, who became his bondsman; and Pi-kan, who reproved him and suffered death.&amp;rdquo;
Hw�i of Liu-hi�, who filled the office of Chief Criminal Judge, was thrice dismissed. A person remarked to him, &amp;ldquo;Can you not yet bear to withdraw?</description>

Tsz-chang: The learned official who when he sees danger ahead will risk his very life, who when he sees a chance of success is mindful of what is just and proper, who in his religious acts is mindful of the duty of reverence, and when in mourning thinks of his loss, is indeed a fit and proper person for his place.&amp;quot;
If a person hold to virtue but never advance in it, and if he have faith in right principles and do not build himself up in them, how can he be regarded either as having such, or as being without them?</description>

Emperor Yau to Shun: Ah, upon you lies the Heaven-appointed order of succession!
Faithfully hold to it, without any deflection. For if within the four seas necessity and want befall the people, your own revenue will forever come to an end.  Shun also used the same language in handing down the appointment to Yu.
Emperor T&amp;rsquo;ang in his prayer: I, the child Li, presume to avail me of an ox of dusky hue, and presume to manifestly announce to God that to the transgressor I dare not grant forgiveness, nor yet keep in abeyance Thy ministers.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Receiving&amp;rdquo; the Reality you Desire A radio does not have to create the program it wishes to hear. It merely needs to receive an already-existing program. It makes itself an effective receiver by matching frequencies, synchronizing frequencies - creating a similarity of vibrations - with the program it wishes to receive.
Likewise, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to create the reality you desire, because it already exists - among the infinite probable realities all simultaneously co-existing.</description>

      <description>The doctrine of miracles is not significant.
But Dr. Tillotson argues against the real presence of miracles. His argument is the most concise, elegant, and strong against miracles.
The authority of Christian scripture or tradition is founded merely in the testimony of the apostles.
 They were the eye-witnesses to the miracles of our Saviour.  Those miracles proved his divine mission.    Our evidence, then, for the truth of the Christian religion is less than the evidence for the truth of our senses.</description>

      <description>1 Book 1 showed that the price of commodities is made up of rent, wages, and profit.
 There are some commodities which has a price made up of wages and profits only. There are very few in which it consists in wages only.  The price of every commodity resolves itself into some one, or other, or all of these three parts. If it goes neither to rent nor wages, then it goes to somebody&amp;rsquo;s profit.</description>

      <description>19 People say that:
Consumable commodities are soon destroyed, but gold and silver are more durable. If not continually exported, gold and silver might be accumulated for ages to increase the country&#39;s real wealth. It is most disadvantageous for any country to trade such lasting commodities for such perishable ones. However, the exchange of English hardware for French wines is not disadvantageous, even if hardware is a very durable commodity.</description>

      <description>Yang Ho was desirous of having an interview with Confucius, but on the latter&amp;rsquo;s failing to go and see him, he sent a present of a pig to his house. Confucius went to return his acknowledgments for it at a time when he was not at home. They met, however, on the way.
He said to Confucius, &amp;ldquo;Come, I want a word with you. Can that man be said to have good-will towards his fellow-men who hugs and hides his own precious gifts and allows his country to go on in blind error?</description>

      <description>Neutral Props In a theater that shows many plays, there may be some props back-stage that are frequently used for several different plays. For each play that prop has a special meaning, but outside that play, the prop has no innate intrinsic built-in meaning. All the props are basically without meaning.
From this innate absence of meaning, we can assign any meaning we want to them.
Likewise, all the events that you experiencing as &amp;ldquo;happening&amp;rdquo; in your life are &amp;ldquo;neutral props&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Yen Yuen: What is man&amp;rsquo;s proper regard for his fellow-man?
Confucius: Self-control, and a habit of falling back upon propriety, virtually effect it.
Let these conditions be fulfilled for one day, and every one round will betake himself to the duty. Is it to begin in one&#39;s self, or think you, indeed! it is to begin in others?  Yen Yuen: Please give me a brief synopsis of it. Then said the Master, &amp;ldquo;Without Propriety use not your eyes; without it use not your ears, nor your tongue, nor a limb of your body.</description>

His answer was, &amp;ldquo;Had you asked me about such things as temple requisites, I have learnt that business, but I have not yet studied military matters.&amp;rdquo; And he followed up this reply by leaving on the following day. After this, during his residence in the State of Ch&amp;rsquo;in, his followers, owing to a stoppage of food supply, became so weak and ill that not one of them could stand.</description>

      <description>Though there be no such thing as Chance in the world; our ignorance of the real cause of any event has the same influence on the understanding, and begets a like species of belief or opinion.
There is certainly a probability, which arises from a superiority of chances on any side; and according as this superiority encreases, and surpasses the opposite chances, the probability receives a proportionable encrease, and begets still a higher degree of belief or assent to that side, in which we discover the superiority.</description>

      <description>Production vs Services 1 Productive labour adds value while unproductive labour does not. The labour of a manufacturer adds to:
 the value of the materials which he works on, the value of his own maintenance, and the value of his master&amp;rsquo;s profit.  On the contrary, the labour of a menial servant adds to the value of nothing.
The manufacturing worker costs nothing to his employer even though the employer pays his wages, because the value of his wages is restored with a profit in the improved value of his manufactured products.</description>

      <description>10 The division of labour greatly increases productivity. This productivity in a well-governed society creates the universal opulence which extends to the poor.
Every worker produces a lot more goods than what he himself needs. This allows all workers to exchange their excess goods among each other, creating a general plenty that diffuses itself through the different ranks of society.
11 The accommodation of a common day-labourer in a civilized country involves a small part of the industry of so many people.</description>

      <description>15 Only the ambiguity of language makes this proposition doubtful or paradoxical. It is obvious when properly understood.
16 When we talk of a sum of money, we sometimes only mean the metal pieces it is made of. Sometimes we include in our meaning some obscure reference to the purchasing power it conveys.
This power is the goods which can be bought with it.
When we say that England&amp;rsquo;s circulating money is £18 million, we only mean the amount of metal pieces which circulate in England.</description>

      <description>All our reasonings concerning matter of fact are founded on a kind of Analogy, which leads us to expect from any cause the same events, which we have observed to result from similar causes.
Where the causes are entirely similar, the analogy is perfect, and the inference, drawn from it, is regarded as certain and conclusive: nor does any man ever entertain a doubt, where he sees a piece of iron, that it will have weight and cohesion of parts; as in all other instances, which have ever fallen under his observation.</description>

      <description>40 It may be deliberated how to properly restore the free importation of foreign goods after it has been interrupted, especially when its local monopoly already employs so many people.
In this case, humanity may require that the freedom of trade should be restored slowly, with much reserve and circumspection.
If those high duties and prohibitions were all removed at once, cheaper foreign goods might enter so fast. They would deprive our people of their employment.</description>

      <description>23 There are two cases when it will be advantageous to lay some burden on foreign industry to encourage domestic industry.
24 When an industry is needed for national defence. When a tax is imposed by foreign countries on certain products of the home country.
Case 1: National Defence For example, Great Britain&amp;rsquo;s defence depends very much on its sailors and shipping.
The act of navigation very properly gives British sailors and shipping the monopoly of British trade by: absolute prohibitions or heavy burdens on foreign shipping The following are the principal dispositions of this Act.</description>

      <description>Insurance Risk 31 The chance of loss is frequently under-valued and rarely valued more than it is worth.
 This is proven by the very moderate profit of insurers.  To be successful in insurance, the common premium must: be sufficient to compensate the common losses pay the expence of management afford a profit equal or bigger than other businesses using the same capital. Paying this premium pays the real value of the risk or the lowest price of insurance.</description>

The people were ignorant of his motives and were unable to admire him for doing so. &amp;quot;Without the Proprieties, we have these results: for deferential demeanor, a worried one; for calm attentiveness, awkward bashfulness; for manly conduct, disorderliness; for straightforwardness, perversity. When men of rank show genuine care for those nearest to them in blood, the people rise to the duty of neighborliness and sociability.</description>

The Carrying Trade We can earn more money by bringing in more foreign goods to be re-sold overseas, since we would not need them locally.
 If we send £100,000 money to Amsterdam to buy Pepper then send it to Italy, it must yield £200,000, doubling the money.</description>

Favours and good acts easily engage their friendship, while the smallest injury provokes their resentment. Any honour or mark of distinction elevates them above measure. But they are as sensibly touched with contempt.

      <description>The passion for philosophy, like that for religion, seems liable to this inconvenience, that, though it aims at the correction of our manners, and extirpation of our vices, it may only serve, by imprudent management, to foster a predominant inclination, and push the mind, with more determined resolution, towards that side which already draws too much, by the bias and propensity of the natural temper.
It is certain that, while we aspire to the magnanimous firmness of the philosophic sage, and endeavour to confine our pleasures altogether within our own minds, we may, at last, render our philosophy like that of Epictetus, and other Stoics, only a more refined system of selfishness, and reason ourselves out of all virtue as well as social enjoyment.</description>

      <description>1 The stock lent at interest is always considered as a capital by its lender.
He expects that:
 it will be restored to him in due time the borrower will pay him a rent for using it  The borrower may use it as a capital or as a stock for immediate consumption. If he uses it as a capital, he employs it to maintain productive labourers.
In this case, he can restore the capital and pay the interest without encroaching on any other source of revenue.</description>

AN act of individual saving means — so to speak — a decision not to have dinner to-day. But it does not necessitate a decision to have dinner or to buy a pair of boots a week hence or a year hence or to consume any specified thing at any specified date.
Thus it depresses the business of preparing to-day’s dinner without stimulating the business of making ready for some future act of consumption.</description>

      <description>The Author Gerard Malynes writes of the admirable feats done by Bankers and Exchangers in using the power of the Exchange.
But he has disguised his own knowledge with sophistry to further some private ends by hurting the public good. He should be discovered and prevented.
The admirable feats to be done by Exchange:
 To invest their money wherever in the world there is a gain in exchange To get rich but never meddle with any Prince&amp;rsquo;s commodities To buy any Prince&amp;rsquo;s commodity using public funds instead of their private money To grow rich and live safely at sea.</description>

      <description>I have already warned of confusing profits with interest. Interest includes all returns from using capital, not just payments from borrower to lender.
The economic meaning excludes compensation for risk — which makes up a great part of interest. But compensation for risk is merely an equalization of return between different uses of capital.
Rates also vary considerably in different countries and at different times. Interest generally has been higher in the United States than in England.</description>

Investment is the use of assets (circulating or fixed) to earn profits.
Interest is the revenue from lending those circulating assets to someone else for them to earn a profit from. Interest rate is the rate of revenue in lending. Savings are the assets that are taken out of one&amp;rsquo;s own circulation to be circulated by someone else.
According to the Classical Theory
Investment is the demand for investable resources Savings represents the supply for investable resources The rate of interest is the “price” of investable resources at which the two are equated</description>

      <description>I
The interest rate of money sets a standard to which the marginal efficiency of a capital-asset must attain if it is to be newly produced. This makes it play a part in limiting the level of employment.
At first sight, this is most perplexing. It is natural to enquire wherein the peculiarity of money lies as distinct from other assets, whether it is only money which has a rate of interest, and what would happen in a non-monetary economy.</description>

      <description>Chapter 11 shows that there are forces causing the rate of investment to rise or fall so as to keep the rate of return on investments equal to the rate of interest.
Yet the rate of return on investments is, in itself, a different thing from the rate of interest.
The investment-demand curve governs how loanable funds are turned to new investment.
The rate of interest governs how funds are being currently supplied.</description>

An oval is never mistaken for a circle, nor an hyperbola for an ellipsis. The isosceles and scalenum are distinguished by boundaries more exact than vice and virtue, right and wrong.

      <description>13 The proportion between industry and idleness is regulated by the proportion between capital and revenue.
Wherever capital predominates, industry prevails. Wherever revenue, idleness.
Therefore, every increase or reduction of capital naturally increases or reduce the real amount of industry.
Capital affects the number of productive hands. The number of productive hands affects the real wealth and revenue of all its inhabitants.

      <description>When a man makes an investment, he buys the right to prospective returns.
I call this &amp;ldquo;the prospective yield of the investment&amp;rdquo;.
This prospective yield has a supply price which is the cost to create that investment.
This supply price is not the market price at which it is bought. The relation between the prospective yield and its supply price gives us its marginal efficiency of capital. It is equal to that rate of discount which would make the present value of the series of annuities given by the returns expected from the capital-asset during its life just equal to its supply price.</description>

To begin with, it may be useful to make clear which elements in the economic system we usually take as given, which are the independent variables of our system and which are the dependent variables. We take as given the existing skill and quantity of available labour, the existing quality and quantity of available equipment, the existing technique, the degree of competition, the tastes and habits of the consumer, the disutility of different intensifies of labour and of the activities of supervision and organisation, as well as the social structure including the forces, other than our variables set forth below, which determine the distribution of the national income.</description>

Chapter 19. Changes in Money-Wages
I
IT would have been an advantage if the effects of a change in money-wages could have been discussed in an earlier chapter. For the Classical Theory has been accustomed to rest the supposedly self-adjusting character of the economic system on an assumed fluidity of money-wages; and, when there is rigidity, to lay on this rigidity the blame of maladjustment. It was not possible, however, to discuss this matter fully until our own theory had been developed.</description>

[1] I IN Chapter 3 (p 25) we have defined the aggregate supply function Z = φ(N), which relates the employment N with the aggregate supply price of the corresponding output. The employment function only differs from the aggregate supply function in that it is, in effect, its inverse function and is defined in terms of the wage-unit; the object of the employment function being to relate the amount of the effective demand, measured in terms of the wage-unit, directed to a given firm or industry or to industry as a whole with the amount of employment, the supply price of the output of which will compare to that amount of effective demand.</description>

Chapter 8 established that employment can only increase pari passu with investment.
We can now carry this line of thought a stage further. For in given circumstances a definite ratio, to be called the Multiplier, can be established between income and investment and, subject to certain simplifications, between the total employment and the employment directly employed on investment (which we shall call the primary employment).</description>

IN the previous chapter Saving and Investment have been so defined that they are necessarily equal in amount, being, for the community as a whole, merely different aspects of the same thing.
Several contemporary writers (including myself in my Treatise on Money) have, however, given special definitions of these terms on which they are not necessarily equal. Others have written on the assumption that they may be unequal without prefacing their discussion with any definitions at all.</description>

Money becomes the measure of commodities because all commodities are products of human labour. Money therefore is the measure of labour time.The expression of the value of a commodity in gold — x commodity A = y money-commodity — is its money-form or price.
1 ton of iron = 2 ounces of gold expresses the value of iron to society.</description>

These faculties may mimic or copy the perceptions of the senses; but they never can entirely reach the force and vivacity of the original sentiment. The utmost we say of them, even when they operate with greatest vigour, is, that they represent their object in so lively a manner, that we could almost say we feel or see it: But, except the mind be disordered by disease or madness, they never can arrive at such a pitch of vivacity, as to render these perceptions altogether undistinguishable.</description>

So far we have established the preliminary conclusion that the volume of employment is determined by the point of intersection of the aggregate supply function with the aggregate demand function.</description>

      <description>II. The Subjective Factors I THERE remains the second category of factors which affect the amount of consumption out of a given income, namely, those subjective and social incentives which determine how much is spent, given the aggregate of income in terms of wage-units and given the relevant objective factors which we have already discussed. Since, however, the analysis of these factors raises no point of novelty, it may be sufficient if we give a catalogue of the more important, without enlarging on them at any length.</description>

      <description>The Origin of the Propensity to Save 28 Regarding profusion, the passion for present enjoyment is the principle which prompts to spend.
It is sometimes violent and very difficult to restrain. Generally, it is only momentary and occasional. The desire of bettering our condition is the principle which prompts to save. It is a desire which is generally calm and dispassionate. It comes with us from birth and never leaves us until we die.</description>

Toil and trouble is more related to suffering and non-suffering. A link to the original translation with the word &amp;lsquo;labour&amp;rsquo; will be posted in the bottom.</description>

      <description>1 The monopoly of domestic industry is secured through high duties or import bans of foreign goods which can be produced at home.
The ban on importing foreign live cattle or foreign salt secures the monopoly of the home market for meat to British graziers. The high duties on wheat imports amount to a ban in times of moderate plenty. Such duties give a like advantage to wheat growers. The ban on woollens importation is equally favourable to woollen manufacturers.</description>

      <description>Depressions and recessions are caused by:
 Land speculation which inflates land values, reduces wages and interest, and thereby checks production. The complexity and interdependence of production Problems with money and credit The artificial barriers of protective tariffs.  Nonetheless, land speculation is the primary cause producing recessions.
As population grows and technology advances, land values rise. This steady increase leads to speculation which anticipates future increases. This raises Land values beyond the point at which labor and capital would receive their customary returns.</description>

Yet it is united in supplying his wants both for war and peace in a plentiful manner from all the parts of Christendom.</description>

      <description>The unequal distribution of wealth is caused by private land ownership. As long private property exists, no increase in production will permanently benefit the masses. On the contrary, any improvements must depress their condition further.
Poverty deepens as wealth increases. Wages fall while productivity grows. This is all because land, the source of all wealth and the field of all labor, is monopolized.
Unequal ownership of land causes unequal distribution of wealth.</description>

      <description>31 The importation of gold and silver is not the sole benefit from foreign trade. All nations derive two benefits from it:
 It carries out their surplus produce which has no demand at home It brings back something else for which there is a demand.  Foreign trade gives a value to their nations&#39; superfluities by exchanging them for something else.
The narrowness of the home market limits a country&amp;rsquo;s division of labour.</description>

      <description>Why does poverty persist despite increasing wealth?
The decline of wages also leads to poverty. So why do wages decrease to subsistence level, even when productive power increases?
Current theory explains that:
 wages are set by the ratio between the number of workers and the amount of capital available for labor population increases faster than the increase in capital therefore, wages always move toward the lowest level that the workers will tolerate.</description>

&#34;The vain man sees the respect which is paid to rank and fortune, and wishes to usurp this respect, as well as that for talents and virtues. His dress, his equipage, his way of living, accordingly, all announce both a higher rank and a greater fortune than really belong to him; and in order to support this foolish imposition for a few years in the beginning of his life, he often reduces himself to poverty and distress long before the end of it.</description>

 an ego which is needed to drive action in physical existence a sense called a conscience to regulate that ego to keep it within its dharma. This sense leads to personal morals or personal do&amp;rsquo;s and dont&amp;rsquo;s while the soul is in the duality of physical existence  Souls can then bind themselves into a new entity called a society which gets its own soul from the individual souls that make it up.</description>

Our model predicts inflation next, as a result of governments applying sophistical mercantile solutions, now known as &amp;ldquo;bailouts&amp;rdquo;, on supply and demand problems. These bailouts will be paid for by either inflation (as college debt, rising bills, rent, etc) or by increased taxation, both will lead to unrest (as seen in the US riots) or a change in government.</description>

To buy anything online, you need a credit card or any electronic system to transfer cash payments. Prior to commercialization, the universal method was barter. For example, the Mongols and the Inca were able to sustain their empires by bartering goods and services.</description>

He gives example of Egypt, India, and China which were technologically backward relative to Rome and Europe.
This implies that Smith preferred the American colonies to stay backward in the short term and source its technology from Britain.</description>

1. Build capital, not expense Capital is anything that produces value. It can be a physical thing like a machine that produces a valuable product or a metaphysical thing like skill, knowledge, relationships, trust, and integrity. Expense is spending that does not return any value. An example is consumption.
Capitals are increased by parsimony and decreased by prodigality and misconduct.</description>

      <description>Taylor Swift&amp;rsquo;s op-ed in The Wall Street Journal shows her continued optimism in the music industry despite its continued downturn caused by the popularity of digital music. She defends her optimism by viewing music as valueable art which can still sell, especially if the buyer falls in love with an artist.
The Pantrynomics of Music While many musicians are alarmed at the decline of the price of their valuable art, Adam Smith assures us that its decline is actually natural:</description>

      <description>To maximize profits, business systems pool money together into the equity that makes up firms and corporations that create, buy, and sell real goods and services in society via secondary arbitrage. In time, these become very good at accumulating capital and starving others of it, causing a recession or crisis. Notice how &amp;lsquo;businesses&amp;rsquo; is a huge entity in the Circular Flow of Economics below. To prevent inequality in Economics, commercial taxation is done.</description>

Here we add that the Experiencer itself is called Consciousness which resides in the arena of the mind. Thus, consciousness and mind go together. An active mind always has consciousness, but a consciousness does not always have an active mind.</description>

      <description>According to Economics, a market dis-equilibrium creates three inefficiencies:
 Producer’s Surplus — defined as “the difference between how much of a good the producer is willing to supply versus how much he receives,” or the gain the producer receives Consumer’s Surplus —defined as a situation when “the price that consumers pay for a product or service is less than the price they’re willing to pay,” or a bargain Deadweight loss — defined as “a cost to society created by market inefficiency”.</description>

 the immortality of the soul and its reincarnation the pantheist God (Brahma) as the source of all souls the superiority of the metaphysical over the physical and so on  Nowadays, dialectics seems to be understood to be an exercise in logic, without any reference to metaphysical truths, God, or to finding solutions.</description>

      <description>To understand the inverted yield curve, we have to understand the nature of bonds.
What are bonds? A bond is a loan to government, giving them private capital to spend for public uses.
However, unlike a normal loan which is paid back in full and can be ended, a bond is a perpetual debt. The investor enters this perpetual lending scheme by buying the bond and then exits at at maturity or by selling his bond back to the market.</description>

      <description>A lot of people confuse socialism, left wing, democracy, and communism with each other. This is because ideas from one generation are commonly usurped by later generations according to their different experiences, rather than creating new names for new ideas arising from those new experiences.
A modern day example is the mobile phone and smartphone. A mobile phone means mobile telephone. When computer-abilities were added to it, it became a ‘smartphone’.</description>

      <description>According to David Hume, a society is bound together by laws from a justice system. These laws were originally created to make people useful to each other and to maintain peace and order.
Initially, these were dictated arbitrarily by a chieftain or king. In time, as the society progressed, those laws were decided by the people themselves through a parliament or senate. This allowed the laws to suit the people and their changing situation.</description>

      <description>The Dialectics of Socrates, or David Hume&amp;rsquo;s science of man, is a system of analysis based on the metaphysical nature or dharma or tao of anything that exists in reality, with the goal of solving real problems in order to keep up with that nature, dharma, or tao.
Socrates calls this dharma or tao as the first principle or true nature of anything.
Dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle.</description>

This means that the mug exists in two layers of reality:
 the physical mug exists in physical reality, which we see the metaphysical mug exists in &amp;lsquo;metaphysical reality&amp;rsquo;, as our idea of what a mug is  Sometimes, we perceive something totally new.</description>

      <description>According to Socrates, inequality takes root most commonly when a society transitions from intellectual rule to an oligarchy:
An Oligarchic State is not one, but two States, the one of poor, the other of rich men. They are living on the same spot and always conspiring against one another. Their fondness for money makes them unwilling to pay taxes. Under such a constitution, the same persons have too many callings. They are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in one.</description>

      <guid>https://superphysics.one/articles/pantrynomics/the-six-types-of-effort/</guid>
      <description>Useful work or effort is one of the foundations of Pantrynomics and is based entirely on Adam Smith’s Effort Theory of Value. This is totally different from Economics and Mercantilism which uses money as the basis through marginal pricing theory.
Since effort is very important, its definition becomes very important. In our theory, we have defined human effort, whether physical or mental, as ultimately rooted in psychological or metaphysical toil and trouble.</description>

      <description>Aside from the division of labor, Adam Smith is famous for his concept of the impartial spectator. This spectator is the thing that guides us to do the right thing and avoid doing wrong. Many people would equate it to conscience, even if Smith mentioned that it is not so:
These must be left to the decision of the man within the breast, the supposed impartial spectator, the great judge and arbiter of our conduct.</description>

      <description>Ricardo&amp;rsquo;s criticism of Smith&amp;rsquo;s wheat-based valuation comes from the fact that he never understood it in the first place. His Labor Theory of Value is based on money-wages and Smith&amp;rsquo;s which is based on grains. Below is a portion of this chapter on value: Adam Smith said that the value of all things was relative to the amount of labour bestowed on their production. He sometimes used wheat, sometimes labour, as a standard measure.</description>

      <description>In The Lectures on Jurisprudence, Adam Smith enumerated the obstacles to agriculture:
  Lack of cultivation by the big land owners
  Payment of the rent in kind
  The farmer has less produce to pay as rent after a bad harvest, but he will have a bit more money to pay because the scarcity will increase the money price of his little harvest.
 Additional taxes by the government (kings)</description>

      <description>The Nash equilibrium, also known as the Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma, comes from Game Theory which is inherently a Mercantile/Commercial idea: Merchant A competes with Merchant B to get points called money. According to Adam Smith, Thomas Mun is the father of this mercantile idea. Mun writes:
But other nations might sell the same goods as we do. This might reduce the demand for our goods. In this case, we must sell as cheap as possible, rather than lose the sale.</description>

 The agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments  A job&amp;rsquo;s difficulty, cleanliness, and/or honorableness can lead to different wage and profit levels
The difficulty and cost of learning them  A job that requires a high degree of techincal skill will lead to higher wages than one that is simple.</description>

Unnatural climate change is caused by excessive greenhouse gases, best represented by carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activity. Though a lot of CO2 emissions come from energy and transportation, food production also contributes greatly to it.</description>

      <description>In Book 3, Chap 2, Adam Smith writes that people should own land only as they can productively use:
A great proprietor is seldom a great improver. In the disorderly times which created those barbarous institutions, the great proprietor was employed in defending his own territories and extending his jurisdiction over his neighbours. He did not have time to cultivate and improve the land. When law and order was established and afforded him this leisure, he often did not have the inclination nor the needed abilities.</description>

      <description>While reviewing my simplification of David Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature Book 3, I came upon a strange wiki article called Hume’s Is-Ought Problem
 Hume calls for caution against such inferences in the absence of any explanation of how the ought-statements follow from the is-statements. But how exactly can an “ought” be derived from an “is”? The question, prompted by Hume’s small paragraph, has become one of the central questions of ethical theory, and Hume is usually assigned the position that such a derivation is impossible.</description>

      <description>Our model, derived from the principles laid by David Hume, Adam Smith, and Socrates, designated 2019 as the spark of a global stagflation. This stagflation will increase from 2020 onwards up to 2030 when it will reach its peak, culminating in some kind of conflict. A stagflation is a phenomenon which has low employment and output while having high prices at the same time.

      <description>Those qualities, which are the ground of preference, and which give occasion to pleasure and pain, are the cause of many insignificant demands, which we by no means stand in need of.
The industry of human life is not employed in procuring food, clothes and lodging. It is employed in procuring those conveniences according to the nicety and delicacy of our taste. To improve and multiply the materials, which are the principal objects of our necessities, creates all the variety of the arts.</description>

      <description>In Glasgow, Smith was a teacher and a learner. The conditions of time and place were most favourable for his instruction.
Had he remained at Oxford, he would probably never have been an economist. had he not spent so many of his best years in Glasgow, he would never have been such an eminent one. He grew into a great economist amid:
 the thickening problems of the Clyde’s rising trade, and the daily discussions they occasioned among the town’s enterprising and intelligent merchants.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3: Education in a despotic Government AS education in monarchies tends to raise and ennoble the mind, in despotic governments its only aim is to debase it. Here it must necessarily be servile: even in power such an education will be an advantage, because every tyrant is at the same time a slave.

I propose, therefore, to rearrange my remarks and to bring them under leading heads.
  All our endeavours or desires so follow from the necessity of our nature, that they can be understood either through it alone, as their proximate cause, or by virtue of our being a part of nature, which cannot be adequately conceived through itself without other individuals.</description>

Smith left Scotland for Oxford in June 1740, riding the whole way on horseback. He told Samuel Rogers many years afterwards that, from the moment he crossed the Border he was much struck with:
 the richness of the country he was entering, and the great superiority of its agriculture over that of his own country.  Scotch agriculture was not born in 1740, even in the Lothians. The country everywhere was very bare and waste.</description>

Her civil polity was equally surprizing. She forbid the Sardinians to cultivate their lands, upon pain of death. She increased her power by her riches, and afterwards her riches by her power. She extended herself along the ocean. The senate of Carthage ordered Hanno to distribute 30,000 Carthaginians from the Strait of Gibraltar as far as Cerne.</description>

He judged, that, by this proceeding, the four principal armies being possessed by the partners in the empire, would naturally intimidate one another, and that the inferior armies being too weak to have any thoughts of raising [124] their chiefs to the imperial dignity, their custom of election would be gradually discontinued, and entirely abolished at last.</description>

      <description>We come now to the third kind of personal rights, those to wit, ex delicto.
Delicts are of two kinds, as they arise ex dolowhen there is a blameable intention, or ex culpawhen they are done through a culpable negligence.
Injury naturally excites the resentment of the spectator, and the punishment of the offender is reasonable as far as the indifferent spectator can go along with it. This is the natural measure of punishment.</description>

      <description>In general, whatever is the foundation of a proper lawsuit may be a just occasion of war.
The lawsuit&amp;rsquo;s foundation is the violation of some perfect right whose performance may be extorted by force.
In modern times, it is decided by the magistrate, lest the society should be disturbed by every person taking justice at his own hands.
The sovereign is bound to demand satisfaction for the following offences:

      <description>It is not easy to determine how far a nation may push its resentment against another nation which has injured it.
The practice of ancient and modern nations differs extremely. In general, resentment is necessary and just when an injury:
 is clearly and distinctly done, or is plainly intended and satisfaction refused.  There are a few cases in which it is lawful even without satisfaction being demanded.
If a robber intended to kill you, it would be quite lawful for you to do all you could to prevent him.</description>

Anciently, there was little commerce between nations and ambassadors were only sent on particular occasions.
 They were what we now call &amp;lsquo;ambassadors extraordinary&amp;rsquo;. They returned home after their business was transacted. There were no resident ambassadors in Rome or Greece. Their duty was just to conclude peace, make alliances, etc.</description>

In Rome, a family might be peregrina for four or five generations.
At Athens, no man was a citizen unless both father and mother were Athenians. The Athenians were particularly sparing in giving the right of citizenship, because it entitled them to very great privileges.</description>

Justice and beneficence are recommended to us by the concern for the happiness of others. Justice restrains us from hurting that happiness. Beneficence prompts us to promote it. Prudence is originally recommended to us by our selfish affections. Justice and beneficence are recommended to us by our benevolent affections. These are recommended to us independent of any regard to: what are, what should be, or what would be the sentiments of other people.</description>

      <description>IF a monarchy can long subsist before it is weakened by its increase, it will become formidable; and its strength w ill remain entire while pent up by the neighbouring monarchies.
It ought not, therefore, to aim at conquests beyond the natural limits of its government. So soon as it has passed these limits it is prudence to stop.
In this kind of conquest things must be left as they were found; the same courts of judicature, the same laws, the same customs, the same privileges: there ought to be no other alteration th an that of the army and of the name of the sovereign.</description>

In mixed confederate republics, where t he association is between petty republics and monarchies of a small extent, this is not so absurd.
Contrary it is also to the nature of thi ngs that a democratical republic should conquer towns which cannot enter in to the sphere of its democracy.</description>

      <description>Taxes on possessions are naturally equal. But taxes on consumptions are naturally unequal. Sometimes they are paid by:
 the merchant the consumer, or the importer, who must be repaid it by the consumer.  In Holland, all goods are deposited in a public warehouse, one key of which is kept by the commissioner of the customs, and another by the owner of the goods. If the goods are exported, no tax is advanced.</description>

      <description>The obligation of contract is based on the reasonable expectation from a promise. A promise is a declaration that you want the promisee to depend on you to perform it. A promise produces an obligation. Its breach is an injury. A promise is different from a mere declaration of intention.
If I say that I want to do something for you, but I do not do it, then I am not guilty of a breach of promise.</description>

      <title>Corruption of Morality by this disposition to admire the rich and despise the poor</title>

      <description>The similarity between the respect for greatness and respect for virtue corrupts morality.
28 We have a disposition to:
 admire, and almost to worship, the rich and the powerful, and neglect or despise persons of poor and mean condition.  Both of these are necessary to establish and maintain:
 the distinction of ranks and the order of society.  However, it is also the most universal cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments.</description>

      <description>17 In the same way, the different situations of ages and countries give different:
 characters to their citizens, and sentiments about the praiseworthiness of those characters, according what is usual.  The politeness highly esteemed, and perhaps thought as effeminate adulation in Russia, would be seen as rudeness and barbarism at the French court.
A Polish nobleman might consider a certain frugality as excessive parsimony. But it might be regarded as extravagance by a citizen of Amsterdam.</description>

      <description>6 According to the ancient rhetoricians, a certain measure of verse was appropriated by nature to each species of writing. Each measure was naturally expressive of the writing&amp;rsquo;s character or feeling. They said that one verse was fit for grave, and another for gay works. These could not be interchanged without the greatest impropriety. However, modern writing contradicts this principle even though modern writing appears extremely proper. The burlesque verse in English is the heroic verse in French.</description>

  A thing is finite when it can be limited by another thing of the same nature.
  For instance, a body is finite because we always conceive another greater body. A thought is limited by another thought. But a body is not limited by thought, nor a thought limited by a body.</description>

      <description>Preface bondage is the human infirmity in moderating and checking the emotions. When a man is a prey to his emotions, he is not his own master. He lies at the mercy of fortune. He is often compelled, while seeing that which is better for him, to follow that which is worse. I will show in this part of my treatise:
 why this is so, and what is good or evil in the emotions.</description>

They take interest from them. They buy up their estates and increase their own wealth and importance.</description>

The eyes are designed to look up at the stars, just as the ears are designed to hear harmonious motions. These are sister sciences, as the Pythagoreans say.

      <description>1 Virtue is the temper of mind in the excellent and praise-worthy character. The nature of virtue may be reduced to three classes:
 The proper direction of all our feelings. These feelings may be virtuous or vicious according to:   their objects and how much they pursue them.  Virtue therefore consists in propriety.

Virtue is in the judicious pursuit of our own private interest and happiness through our selfish feelings.</description>

      <description>When everyone went out, there could be no military discipline.
They were all on the same level. Discipline was unnecessary because their common cause was so well discerned. When the highest orders went out, a principle of honour would supply the place of discipline. But when this office fell on the lowest order, the most severe and rigid discipline became necessary. Accordingly, discipline has been introduced into all standing armies. Generally, they should be kept under such authority as to be more afraid of their general and officers than of the enemy.</description>

Such are families which have possessed some large estate from father to son for many generations. In countries which have little commerce, such as Wales or the Scottish highlands on the contrary, they are very common. The Arabian histories seem to be all full of genealogies. There is a history written by a Mongol Khan which contains nothing else.</description>

      <description>During his stay in Glasgow, Smith maintained intimate relations with his old friends in Edinburgh.
 He often visited them by coach even if the journey took 13 hours before the road was improved. He spent most of his many successive vacations among them. He actively promoted some literary, scientific, and social improvement projects then widespread in Scotland. His patron was Henry Home.  In 1752, Mr. Home was raised to the bench as Lord Kames.</description>

      <description>Entails engrossed land the most and therefore, it took the longest to be established.
It was very natural to give a man a right to dispose of his property while he lived.
But a testament supposes that he has this right even after death. This right could not be transferred because the heir does not have the same right. Puffendorf whimsically accounts for this from the soul&amp;rsquo;s immortality.
At Rome, the right of making testaments was introduced gradually.</description>

 in favour of the modest man, and against the man of excessive self-esteem.  A man fears no humiliation if he does not ascribe to himself any other merit besides that which really belongs to him.</description>

The heir has a privilege of demanding what belonged to the deceased. After he is admitted heir, it is his real property. If a person starts to chase a wild beast, he has an exclusive privilege of pursuing it. Whoever comes in on the chase can be punished because he breaks the exclusive privilege.</description>

      <description>Two things are required in voluntary transference:
 A declaration of the intention of the transferer, and of the transferee The actual delivery of the thing.  In most cases, the first of these is not binding without the latter, because there is no right without possession.
If a man borrowed a thing and afterwards bought it, there is no need of delivery because he already has it.
Before possession you can have no right to the thing, though you may have a right to make the man keep his promise.</description>

 By occupation, or the taking possession of what formerly belonged to nobody. By accession, when a man has a right to one thing in consequence of another, as of a horse’s shoes along with the horse. By prescription, which is a right to a thing belonging to another arising from long and uninterrupted possession.</description>

Colleagues in office, partners in trade, call one another brothers. They frequently feel as brothers towards each other.
 Their good agreement is an advantage to all. Their disagreement is a sort of a small scandal.  The Romans expressed this sort of attachment by the word necessitudo.</description>

      <description>The Weakness of the King (Conservatives) Led to the Rise of the Free Traders (Liberals) 9 The kings who hated their barons gave the most liberal grants to their burghs.
For example, King John of England was a most munificent benefactor to his towns.
Philip 1st of France lost all authority over his barons.
 Louis 6th was the son of Philip 1st  According to Father Daniel, towards the end of the reign of Philip 1st, Louis 6th consulted with the bishops on how to restrain the great lords.</description>

      <description>Commerce is subject to great revolutions. Yet its nature may be forever fixed by physical causes such as:
 the quality of the soil or the climate  We currently trade with India merely through the silver which we send. The Romans annually had a trade volume with India of about 50,000,000 sesterces in exchange for Indian merchandise
It is Nature itself that produces this effect. The Indians have their arts adapted to their manner of living.</description>

      <description>The laws of governance should be relative to the principle of each government, just as the laws of education are.
The relation of laws to this principle strengthens the several springs of government. This principle derives from thence, in its turn, a new degree of vigour.
And thus it is, in mechanics, that action is al ways followed by re-action.
We examine this relation in each government, beginning with the republican state, whose principle is virtue.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6: Some Institutions among the Greeks THE ancient Greeks, convinced of the necessity that people who live under a popular government should be trained up to virtue, made very singular institutions in order to inspire it. Upon seeing, in the life of Lycurgus, the laws that legislator gave to the Lacedæmonians, I imagine I am reading the history of the Sevarambes. The laws of Crete were the model of those of Sparta; and those of Plato reformed them.</description>

      <description>When a father dies leaving his children young, they should be taken care of. Even in the times of exposition, when an infant was some time kept, it was thought cruel to put him to death: the child was destitute there were then no hospitals or places of charity: it must therefore be put into the custody of some person.
The law fixed the father’s side nearest relation to care for the child.</description>

In a despotism, mankind is all equal no one person can prefer himself to another
Yet, they are all slaves, they can give themselves no sort of preference., as honour has its laws and rules; as it knows not how to submit; as it depends, in a great measure, on a man’s own caprice, and not on that of another person;</description>

 a group of military countries form an alliance for mutual defense or to attack another country a group of criminals agree to join forces to be a crime syndicate a group of teenagers agree to meet after school to start a rock band  All such alliances, syndicates, and bands are societies that require its members to agree to be part of the group or project.</description>

      <description>AS soon as a republic has compassed the = destruction of those who wanted to subvert it, there should be an end of te= rrors, punishments, and even of rewards.
Great punishments, and consequently grea= t changes, cannot take place without investing some citizens with an exorbi= tant power. It is therefore more adviseable, in this case, to exceed in len= ity, than in severity; to banish but few, rather than many; and to leave th= em their estates, instead of making a vast number of confiscations.</description>

 this liberty was lost, and how monarchy was introduced.  The republics mentioned must either:
 confine themselves within their ancient boundaries, or enlarge their territory by conquest.  They must either be a defensive republic or a conquering one. The Greek states are a good example of a defensive republic. Rome and Carthage are examples of conquering republics.</description>

      <description>AMONG the several kings whom the Romans invaded, Mithridates was the only one who made a courageous defence, and exposed them to danger.
His dominions were situated to wonderful advantage for carrying on a war with them: they bordered on the inaccessible countries of mount Caucasus, peopled with savage nations, whom that prince could call to his assistance; they thence extended along the sea of Pontus, which Mithridates covered with his ships, and he was incessantly purchasing new armies of Scythians: Asia was open to his invasions; and he was rich, because his cities, situated on the Pontus Euxinus, carried on an advantageous traffic with nations less industrious than themselves.</description>

      <description>108 The general rules which distribute prosperity and adversity are perfectly suited to mankind&amp;rsquo;s situation. Yet they are not suited to some of our natural feelings. We naturally love some virtues so much that we want to give them honours. On the contrary, we detest some vices so much that we want to give them every disgrace. Magnanimity, generosity, and justice, command so much admiration.
We want to see them crowned with wealth, power, and honours.</description>

      <description>Our Sympathy with the Sorrow of Others is Stronger than Our Sympathy with the Joy of Others because pain is a stronger sensation than pleasure (which can even be a source of envy) 1 Our sympathy with sorrow has been more noticed than our sympathy with joy. In its most proper and primitive signification, the word &amp;lsquo;sympathy&amp;rsquo; denotes our fellow-feeling with the sufferings of others, not with their enjoyments.

      <description>Early societies had democratic governments. How were republican governments introduced?
Generally, a country&amp;rsquo;s location and its improvement in agriculture and trade make it favourable to the introduction of a republican government.
There is little probability that republican governments will ever be introduced into Mongolia or Arabia, because their country cannot be improved.
 Most part of its lands are hills and deserts and is only fit for pasture They are generally dry and do not have any big rivers.</description>

      <description>IN order to make the purchaser confound the price of the commodity with the tax, there must be some proportion between the tax and the value of the commodity. This is why there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an excessive duty on cheap merchandise.
In some countries, the duty exceeds 18 times the value of the commodity. In this case, the prince removes the disguise. His subjects plainly see they are dealt with unreasonably.</description>

      <description>We shall next show how this division of labour multiplies productivity, or, which is the same thing, how opulence arises from it.
Let us observe the effect of the division of labour in some manufactures. If all the parts of a pin were made by one man, it would take him a whole year to make one pin.
He would:
 dig the ore, smelt it, and split the wire.  Therefore, this pin must be sold at the expense of his maintenance for that time.</description>

      <description>The House of Commons became considerable. But how did the nobility’s power decrease and how did the government become arbitrary?
Previously by their ancient rustic hospitality, all the European courts could easily maintain 1,000 retainers. Richard, Earl of Warwick was styled as a King. He maintained 40,000 people everyday besides tenants.
But when luxury took place, he was unable to do this. Thus, the nobility&amp;rsquo;s power was reduced before the House of Commons had established its authority through an arbitrary king.</description>

They should endeavour to support the nobility; in respect to whom, honour may be, in some measure, deemed both child and parent.
They should render the nobility hereditary; not as a boundary between the power of the prince and the weakness of the people, but as the link which connects them both.</description>

A tribunal arose which judged all nations: At the close of every war they determined the rewards or punishments which every one had merited: They took away from the vanquished people, part of their lands, and gave them to their allies, in which they did two things; they engaged, in the interests of Rome, princes from whom they had little to fear, and much to hope; and they weakened others from whom they had nothing to hope, and every thing to fear.</description>

      <description>Chapter 10: Banks IN economical commercial states, they have luckily established banks which have created a new kind of wealth by their credit. But it would be wrong to introduce banks into governments whose commerce is founded only in luxury.
In an absolute monarchy, only the prince or can have treasure. If wealth is created by others then it is seized by the prince. Thus, banks in an absolute monarchy would suppose money on one side but without any power, and power on the other side but without any means to procure.</description>

      <description>EXCESSIVE punishments may even corrupt a despotic government as seen in Japan.
There, almost all crimes are punished with death because disobedience to the great Japanese emperor is reckoned an enormous crime. The question is not so much to correct the delinquent, as to vindicate the emperor&amp;rsquo;s authority.
These notions:
 are derived from servitude come mainly from the emperor being the universal proprietor.  These render almost all crimes to be directly against his interests.</description>

      <description>It is commonly supposed that the premium of interest depends on the value of gold and silver. The value of these are regulated by their quantity. As the quantity increases, the value diminishes. As the quantity decreases, the value rises.
However, the premium of interest is regulated by the quantity of stock.
Around the time of the discovery of the West Indies, the common interest was at 10% or 12%. Since that time, it has gradually diminished.</description>

      <description>The rules which nations should observe, or do observe with one another, cannot be treated so accurately as private or public law.
The rules of property are pretty exactly established in every nation. The extent of the sovereign’s power and the subject&amp;rsquo;s duty, so far as justice is concerned, are pretty uniform everywhere. But with respect to the laws of nations, we cannot mention any one regulation: established with the common consent of all nations, and observed at all times.</description>

      <description>THE managing of the revenues by commission is like the conduct of a good father of a family, who collects his own rents himself with economy and order. It:
 allows the prince to press or retard the levy of the taxes, either according to his own wants or to those of his people saves the state the immense profits of tax collectors [tax farmers], who impoverish it a thousand ways lets the prince prevent the people from being mortified with the sight of sudden fortunes lets the public money pass through few hands, go directly to the treasury, and consequently makes a quicker return to the people.</description>

      <description>Pantrynomics solves all economic problems by adding barter and points-based valuation to the current money-based valuation. The points-based valuation represents the effort theory of value which we derived from Adam Smith:
Labour..is the only universal, as well as the only accurate measure of value.. by which we can compare the values of different commodities at all times and at all places.. From century to century, corn is a better measure than silver, because, from century to century, equal quantities of corn will command the same quantity of labour more nearly than equal quantities of silver.</description>

Being perfect, therefore, has:  wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.  Wisdom is the first virtue found in a State. It means being good in counsel. Good counsel is a kind of knowledge because ignorant men cannot counsel well. There are many and diverse kinds of knowledge in a State, such as the knowledge carpentry.</description>

Glaucon: Socrates, you have not persuaded us that to be just is always better than to be unjust. There are three kinds of positives:   Those which are desired for their own sakes, and independently of their consequences.</description>

They mutually incommoded one another, and all the politics of those times consisted in setting them at variance together. This was a circumstance easy to accomplish since their avarice and fierce dispoposition greatly contributing to make it practicable.
The largest of them was therefore destroyed before they could settle themselves. This was how the Eastern empire still subsisted for some time.</description>

Hume thought that the countryside was unsuitable for a man of letters. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to move to Edinburgh. But Smith had everything he needed in Kirkcaldy:

      <description>Good is Not Pleasure The person who wants to see the soul in its perfect beauty must take a longer route to find such beauty in it. But beauty is the same as opinion which needs a measure common to all. Indolent people use measures based on their own limited perceptions.
This would be the worst fault in a guardian and of the laws.
The guardian then must be required to take the longer circuit.</description>

      <description>The new edition of the Theory was Smith’s last published work. A French newspaper, the Moniteur Universelle of Paris, announced on March 11, 1790 that Smith would do a critical examination of Montesquieu’s Esprit des Lois.
It speculated that the work would make an epoch in the history of politics and of philosophy.
But there is no evidence that he intended to publish a separate work on Montesquieu. Before March 1790, his strength seems to have been much wasted.</description>

      <description>Master and servant is the third relation of a family. The same principle which gave the husband authority over the wife, also gave the father authority over the son. The husband&amp;rsquo;s power was softened through his wife’s friends. She could complain to them. The father was softened by the same means.
But it was not so with the servants who had nobody to complain to. The master had the power of life and death over them.</description>

      <description>11 A species of farmers known as Metayers in France gradually succeeded the ancient slaves.
They are called Coloni Partiarii in Latin. They were so long in disuse in England that I know no English name for them at present. The proprietor furnished them with the whole stock needed for cultivating the farm. After setting aside what was necessary for keeping up the stock, the produce was divided equally between the proprietor and the farmer.</description>

      <description>What form of government succeeded the republican?
When small republics were conquered by another state, monarchy, or whatever government the conquerors wanted was established. They generally followed the model of their own country.
 The Athenians always established democracy. The Spartans established aristocracy. The Romans more prudently divided their conquests into provinces.  These were governed pretty absolutely by persons appointed by the Senate. The case is somewhat different when a state is conquered by its own people.</description>

 The measure of value, and then The medium of exchange.  When people deal in many kinds of goods, one of them must be considered as the measure of value. Suppose there were only three commodities, sheep, corn, and oxen.
We can easily remember them comparatively. But if we have 100 different commodities, there are 99 values of each, arising from a comparison with each of the rest.</description>

 the value of gold and silver is arbitrary and depends on constitution and agreement. the idea of value can be brought to paper and preferred to money.  If this could be done, he thought it would be a great convenience. The government could then do what it pleased:</description>

      <description>But labour, not money, is the true measure of value. Therefore, national opulence consists in:
 the quantity of goods and the facility of barter  The more money that is needed to circulate the goods of any country, the fewer the goods.
Suppose Scotland&amp;rsquo;s total stock of corn, cattle, money, etc. amounts to 20 million.
 If 1 million in cash is needed to circulate it, there will only be 19 million of food, clothes, and lodging.</description>

      <description>Chapter 9: The Severity of Punishments in different Governments. THE severity of punishments is fitter for despotic governments, whose principle is terror, than for a monarchy or a republic, whose spring is honour and virtue.
In moderate governments, the love of one’s country, shame, and the fear of blame, are restraining motives, capable of preventing a multitude of crimes. Here the greatest punishment of a bad action is conviction. The civil laws have, therefore, a softer way of correcting, and do not require so much force and severity.</description>

      <description>LUXURY indicates the inequality of fortunes.
If the riches of a state are equally divided, there will be no luxury, because luxury is founded merely on the inconveniences from the labour of others.
In order to have this equal distribution of riches, the law should give to each man only what is necessary for nature. If they exceed these bounds, some will spend, and others will acquire. These will lead to inequality.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6: The Luxury of China SUMPTUARY laws might be necessary in some governments.
The population may grow so large because of the climate. The uncertainty of food might render a universal application to agriculture extremely necessary.
Luxury, in such countries, is dangerous. This would cause their sumptuary laws to be very severe.
In order, therefore, to be able to judge whether luxury ou ght to be encouraged or proscribed, we should examine, first, what relation there is between the number of people and the facility they have of procur ing subsistence.</description>

      <description>Introduction 1 Merit and Demerit are another set of qualities ascribed to mankind&amp;rsquo;s actions and conduct, distinct from propriety or decency.
 Merit is the quality deserving reward. Demerit is the quality deserving punishment.  These are the objects of a distinct species of approbation.
2 Feelings have two aspects or relations:
 In relation to the cause which excites it   An action&amp;rsquo;s propriety or decency depends on the suitableness of the feeling, which creates the action, to the cause which excites it.</description>

      <description>How the Timocracts Become Oligarchs An oligarchic government is one resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it. The rulers are elected for their wealth. I shall explain the transition from timocracy to oligarchy.
The accumulation of gold in private individuals is the ruin of timocracy. They invent illegal modes of expenditure because they do not care about the law.</description>

The authority of the father over his children, both with respect to liberty and property, was at first absolute. He was at liberty to choose whether he would bring up his children or not, and it was accounted no injustice to refuse to do it.</description>

It was just enough to render that situation as objects of:
 simple preference, but not of earnest desire, simple rejection, but not of earnest aversion.  The certainty by which our happiness settles to match our permanent situation would make us think that the Stoics were correct.</description>

But if philosophy ever finds perfection in a State, then she will be seen in truth divine and that all other things, whether natures of men or institutions, are but human.</description>

      <description>Pledges and mortgages are certain securities for the payment of debts.
At first, they could not be claimed as real rights. Afterwards, the law considered them as such.
Pledges properly regard moveable subjects, and mortgages immoveable. If a pledge be not redeemed at a certain time, it is forfeited.
People in bad circumstances are naturally slothful. The negligence of Romans debtors led to the lex commissaria which empowered the creditor to:</description>

      <description>In many countries, men took as many wives as they could maintain.
Voluntary divorce has inconveniences. Yet it is still within justice that a man should divorce his wife and take another for less reasons than adultery, because they make them quite unhappy together though either of them might live well elsewhere.
The same is the case with polygamy. If a woman consents to be one of five or more wives and the law allows it, then there is no injury done to her.</description>

These athletes:  sleep away their lives, and are liable to the most dangerous illnesses if they depart from their customary regimen.  A finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes, who are:
 to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and food, of summer heat and winter cold, which they will have to endure when on a campaign.</description>

The harmonies which express sorrow are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and the full-toned or bass Lydian, and those similar.</description>

The idea of God, from which an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways, can only be one. 5.

      <description>A true knowledge of good and evil cannot check any emotion by virtue of being true, but only in so far as it is considered as an emotion.  Desire arising from the knowledge of good and bad can be quenched or checked by many of the other desires arising from the emotions whereby we are assailed.  Desire arising from the knowledge of good and evil, in so far as such knowledge regards what is future, may be more easily controlled or quenched, than the desire for what is agreeable at the present moment.</description>

      <description>Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire. Proof: Let it be granted that the mind is simultaneously affected by two emotions, of which one neither increases nor diminishes its power of activity, and the other does either increase or reduce the said power (3. Post. 1).  Corollary: Simply from the fact that we have regarded a thing with the emotion of pleasure or pain, though that thing be not the efficient cause of the emotion, we can either love or hate it.</description>

      <description>30. Intellect, in function (actu) finite, or in function infinite, must comprehend the attributes of God and the modifications of God, and nothing else. 31. The intellect in function, whether finite or infinite, as will, desire, love, etc., should be referred to passive nature and not to active nature. 32. Will cannot be called a free cause, but only a necessary cause. 33. Things could not have been brought into being by God in any manner or in any order different from that which has in fact obtained.</description>

      <description>Part 2: Common ideas We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of particular things external to ourselves.  Corollary: Hence it follows that all particular things are contingent and perishable.
 All ideas, in so far as they are referred to God, are true. Proof: All ideas which are in God agree in every respect with their objects (2.7. Coroll.), therefore (1. Ax. 6) they are all true.</description>

      <description>When we love a thing similar to ourselves we endeavour, as far as we can, to bring about that it should love us in return.  The greater the emotion with which we conceive a loved object to be affected towards us, the greater will be our complacency.  If anyone conceives, that an object of his love joins itself to another with closer bonds of friendship than he himself has attained to, he will be affected with hatred towards the loved object and with envy towards his rival.</description>

      <description>God&amp;rsquo;s intellectual love, arising from intuition, is eternal.
  The mind is subject to those emotions which are attributable to passions, only while the body endures. Proof: Imagination is the idea wherewith the mind contemplates a thing as present (2.17 note). Yet this idea indicates rather the present disposition of the human body than the nature of the external thing (2.16. Coroll. 2). Therefore, emotion (see general Def. of Emotions) is imagination, as it indicates the present disposition of the body.</description>

      <description>If a man has begun to hate an object of his love, so that love is thoroughly destroyed, he will, causes being equal, regard it with more hatred than if he had never loved it, and his hatred will be in proportion to the strength of his former love. Proof: If a man begins to hate that which he had loved, more of his appetites are put under restraint than if he had never loved it.</description>

      <description>When the mind regards itself and its own power of activity, it feels pleasure: and that pleasure is greater in proportion to the distinctness wherewith it conceives itself and its own power of activity.  The mind endeavours to conceive only such things as assert its power of activity.  When the mind contemplates its own weakness, it feels pain thereat.  Corollary: This pain is more and more fostered, if a man conceives that he is blamed by others; this may be proved in the same way as the corollary to 3.</description>

      <description>The mind, both in so far as it has clear and distinct ideas, and also in so far as it has confused ideas, endeavours to persist in its being for an indefinite period, and of this endeavour it is conscious.  An idea, which excludes the existence of our body, cannot be postulated in our mind, but is contrary thereto.  Whatsoever increases or diminishes, helps or hinders the power of activity in our body, the idea thereof increases or diminishes, helps or hinders the power of thought in our mind.</description>

      <description>Introduction 1 We naturally view an individual&amp;rsquo;s character under two aspects:
 As it may affect his own happiness As it may affect the happiness of others  2 Nature first recommends the body&amp;rsquo;s preservation and healthful state to every individual&amp;rsquo;s care. Hunger and thirst, pleasure and pain, heat and cold, etc. are lessons delivered by the voice of Nature herself. Nature directs him what he should choose and avoid. Most of his first lessons from his parents also teaches him how to keep out of harm&amp;rsquo;s way.</description>

Hence it is that the sage legislators of republican states have ever required of women a particular gravity of manne rs.</description>

      <description>18 We only thoroughly sympathize with Person A&amp;rsquo;s gratitude to Person B if we totally go along with the motives of Person B. We must go along with Person B&amp;rsquo;s feelings, before we can entirely sympathize with Person A&amp;rsquo;s gratitude.
19 When we sympathize with Person B&amp;rsquo;s feelings, and if it matches Person A&amp;rsquo;s gratitude, then our love for Person B enhances our fellow-feeling with Person A&amp;rsquo;s gratitude. Person B&amp;rsquo;s actions seem then to call aloud for a proportional recompense.</description>

      <description>The Story of Er I will tell you of the heroic tale of Er the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle. Ten days later when the bodies of the dead are decomposing, his body was found unaffected by decay. It was carried home to be buried.
On the 12th day, as he was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world.</description>

      <description>IT is a general rule that taxes:
 can be higher the more liberty a person has, and should be lower the more enslaved a person is.  This has always been and always will be the case. It is a rule derived from nature that never varies.
We find it in all parts, in England, in Holland, and in every state where liberty gradually declines, till we come to Turkey.</description>

      <title>Second way of acquiring Property: Accession</title>

      <guid>https://superphysics.one/research/smith/jurisprudence/part-1/section-3/chapter-2/</guid>
      <description>The right of accession is not so much founded in its utility as in the impropriety of not joining it to that object on which it has a dependence.
The milk of a cow I have purchased may not be of great value, but it is very improper that another person should have a right to bring up his calf upon it. The most important accessions are in land property. Land property is founded on division or an assignation by the society to a particular person of a right to sow and plant a certain piece of ground.</description>

      <description>1 A man is said to be perfectly virtuous if he acts according to the rules of:
 perfect prudence, strict justice, and proper benevolence.  But the perfect knowledge of those rules alone will not enable him to act in this way. His own passions:
 are very apt to mislead him, and sometimes drive and seduce him to violate all the rules which he himself approves of in all his sober and cool hours  The perfect knowledge will not always enable him to do his duty if it is not supported by the most perfect self-command.</description>

      <description>22 The principle of self-estimation may be too high or too low.
It is so very agreeable to think highly or meanly of ourselves. To the person himself, some excess must be less disagreeable than any defect. But to the impartial spectator, things must appear quite differently. To him, the defect must always be less disagreeable than the excess. in our companions, we much more frequently complain of the excess than the defect.</description>

      <description>The second kind of real rights is servitudes. These are burdens which one man has on another person&amp;rsquo;s property. These rights were at first personal.
They were entered into by a contract between the persons. I need to have a road to the market town. If a man’s estate lies between me and the town, I must bargain with him to have a road through it.
This contract produces only a personal right.</description>

      <description>Imitation is Thrice removed from the truth. One of the many excellences in our State is the rejection of imitative poetry. All poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers. The knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them. I have always had an awe and love of Homer. He is the great teacher of the poets on tragedy. But a man is not to be revered more than the truth.</description>

 By being captives in war.   If the conqueror does not kill them, he has a right to make them slaves.  By being children of slaves. By being guilty of crimes.   They becames slaves to the person injured or to the public.  By being in debt in the ancient state of the Roman Republic.   If they could not pay their debt, it was thought reasonable they should work for it.</description>

      <description>SOMETIMES the pusillanimous spirit of the emperors † , and frequently the defenceless state of the empire made the people employ their money to appease the nations that threatened to invade them; but the desired peace could never be effectually purchased, because those who sold it could, whenever they pleased, oblige the Romans to buy it again.
It is much better to hazard an unsuccessful war, than to part with great sums for a precarious peace; for a prince is always suspected when it is known he will make a long resistance before he can be vanquished.</description>

      <description>In this way, standing armies came to be introduced.
Armies should be raised:
 in the most convenient way, and with the least possible hurt to the country.  Many standing armies may be exclaimed against. But they must be introduced in a certain period of society. A militia commanded by landed gentlemen in possession of the nation&amp;rsquo;s public offices would never sacrifice the country&amp;rsquo;s liberties for anyone. Such a militia would be the best security against a foreign standing army.</description>

      <description>The practice of stock-jobbing is the buying stocks by time.
It also has a very big influence on the rise and fall of stocks. A man who only has £1,000 subscribes for £100,000, which is delivered:
 at several fixed times, and in certain portions.  He hopes to sell these portions at profit by the rising of the stocks before they fall. But since his worth would go down if the stocks fall, he does everything to make them rise.</description>

      <description>Soon after the Revolution, the government needed to borrow money from its subjects at a higher rate than common interest.
It had to be repaid in a few years. The funds to pay this interest were taxes on certain commodities. These taxes were at first laid on for a certain number of years, according to the term for which the money was borrowed. But these loans became perpetual by various arts of government.</description>

 recommended to its own care, and endowed with self-love  It causes every animal to preserve its existence as best as it can.
20 The self-love of man embraced his entire mind and body and desired their preservation. Whatever supported this state was naturally chosen. Whatever destroyed it, was rejected. These make us prefer health, strength, agility, and ease of body, and the eternal conveniences which promoted these.</description>

He attended three sessions, going through the classes of Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and Moral Philosophy. These classes drew students from afar and had remarkable intellectual activity.
Dr. A. Carlyle came to Glasgow College formoved his divinity classes after he had finished his arts course at Edinburgh.</description>

      <description>Suicide is rooted on pride 35 Suicide was never very common among the Greeks. I cannot remember any illustrious Greek hero who died by his own hand, other than Cleomenes.
Aristomenes&#39; death is as much beyond the period of true history as that of Ajax. The common story of Themistocles&#39; death was within that period.
However, it bears all the marks of a most romantic fable.
Of all the Greek heroes written by Plutarch, Cleomenes is the only one who died by suicide.</description>

 interest him in the fortune of others, and render the happiness of others necessary to him, even if he only gets the pleasure of seeing that happiness  Pity or compassion is our feeling for the misery of others.

When there is no disapproval of the Erring Person&amp;rsquo;s motives, there is no sympathy with the Sufferer&amp;rsquo;s resentment 15 A benefactor&amp;rsquo;s action merits little reward if his good motives were misplaced, no matter how beneficial it was. The lack of a proper motive prevents us from having sympathy with his beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s gratitude. In this case, little gratitude is due.</description>

      <description>THE state of villainage is sometimes established after a conquest. In that case the bondman or villain that tills the land ought to have a kind of partnership with his master. Nothing but a communication of loss or profit can reconcile those who are doomed to labour to such as are blessed with a state of affluence.
Chapter 4: A Republic in the like Case WHEN a republic has reduced a nation to the drudgery of cultivating her lands, she ought never to suffer the free subject to have a power of increasing the tribute of the bondman.</description>

      <description>After the appropriation of land property, some lands were commonly assigned to maintain the government. The free states of Greece had land set apart for this purpose.
Aristotle thought that private property should surround the royal lands because:
 the people near a city were always for war, they were sure of defence, and the enemy would first come upon those lands near the boundaries  In all barbarous countries, lands are appropriated to the purposes of sovereignty.</description>

      <description>The great advantages of liberty causes that liberty itself to be abused.
 A moderate government produces admirable effects and so this moderation is laid aside A moderate government produces great taxes, and so they want raise even more They received such gifts from liberty, but they go to slavery who never gives such  Liberty produces high tax revenues The effect of high tax revenues is slavery Slavery reduces tax revenues    The eastern monarchs exempt every year some of their provinces from paying tribute as a favour.</description>

They:
 have lived inside the cave from childhood have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move can only see in front of them  The chains prevent them from moving their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance.</description>

      <description>The government which succeeded the fall of the Roman Empire was similar to Mongols. Germans and other groups conquered the the western countries. Compared to the Mongols, they:
 had better notions of property, and were a little more used to the division of lands.  The conquering king and the other chieftains would naturally:
 take more land and distribute it among their vassals and dependents, and leave only a tiny share to the ancient inhabitants.</description>

      <description>40 Two sets of virtues are founded on these two efforts:
 The observer&amp;rsquo;s effort to enter into the observee&amp;rsquo;s feelings  On this effort is founded:
 the soft, gentle, amiable virtues, and the virtues of candid condescension and indulgent humanity.  The observee&amp;rsquo;s effort to bring down his emotions to what the observer can go along with  From this effort originates the respectable virtues of self-denial and self-control.</description>

      <description>The Sense of Merit arises from sympathy 22-23 The sense of merit is a compounded feeling made up of two distinct feelings:
 A direct sympathy with the subject-person&amp;rsquo;s feelings An indirect sympathy with its object-person&amp;rsquo;s gratitude  24 Many times, we can plainly distinguish these two feelings uniting in our sense of merit of a character or action. After we read about beneficent actions, we:
 are animated by their high-spirited generosity become keen for their success and grieve at their disappointment imagine that we are the subject-person and bring ourselves to those adventures.</description>

      <description>100 The sense of duty is the regard to the general rules of conduct.
It is a principle of the greatest consequence in human life. It is the only principle by which most of mankind can direct their actions. Many men behave very decently. They perhaps never felt the sentiment on propriety. They might have acted merely from a regard to the established rules of behaviour. The man who has received great benefits from another person may feel just a small gratitude.</description>

      <description>The idea of public opulence consisting in money has led to the most pernicious regulations. These think:
 that the commerce which drain us of our money are disadvantageous and so such commerce is prohibited and that the commerce which increase money are beneficial and is encouraged  France is thought to produce more of the elegancies of life than England. We take much from them and they need little from us and so the balance of trade is against us.</description>

      <description>Because of these tenets, the government banned coin exportation.
This ban has been extremely hurtful to the country&amp;rsquo;s commerce. Because whatever amount of money there is in any country above what is needed for circulation is merely a dead stock.
In King William’s time, there were two species of coin:
 milled unmilled  The unmilled was frequently clipped while in circulation. This caused frequent disorders among the people. The parliament ordered all the clipped money to be brought into the mint.</description>

      <description>Introduction 1 The spectator can go along with our feelings which lie in a certain middle. If it is too high or too low, he cannot enter into it. For example, grief for private misfortunes and injuries may easily be too high in many people. They may also be too low, but rarely.
 We call excessive grief as &amp;lsquo;weakness&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;fury&amp;rsquo;. We call the shortage of grief as &amp;lsquo;stupidity&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;insensibility&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;lack of spirit&amp;rsquo;.</description>

 The heart&amp;rsquo;s intention, or The resulting physical action caused by the intention or The consequences which actually result from the action  These three:
 constitute the whole nature of the action are the foundation of the action&amp;rsquo;s quality.  2 The action and its consequences obviously cannot be the foundation of any praise or blame.

      <description>It is surprising for nations to continue to be poor for so long when we consider the immediate effects of the division of labour in improving the arts.
This is caused by natural impediments and the oppression by the government.
Lack of Division of Labor or Teamwork A barbarous people are ignorant of the effects of the division of labour. It takes a long time before a person can produce more than is necessary for his daily subsistence.</description>

      <description>Chapter 16: The Communication of Power IN a despotic government, the power is communicated entire to the person intrusted with it. The vizir himself is the despotic prince; and each particular officer is the vizir. In monarchies, the power is less immediately applied, being tempered by the monarch as he gives it‡. He makes such a distribution of his authority, as never to communicate a part of it without reserving a greater share to himself.</description>

      <description>I think that the sect of Epicurus, which began to be propagated at Rome, towards the close of the republic, was very prejudicial to the minds and genius of the people.
The Greeks had been infatuated with its doctrines long before. Consequently, they were corrupted much earlier than the Romans. Polybius says that oaths, in his time, could not induce any person to place confidence in a Greek, whereas they were considered by a Roman as inviolable obligations upon his conscience.</description>

But some hope seems to have been entertained of Hume coming up even without Smith&amp;rsquo;s persuasion and escort.
Bishop John Home thought so. He was in London and was in correspondence with Hume. But Hume wrote no, in a letter on April 12.</description>

      <description>16 A taste for the finer and more improved manufactures was introduced by foreign commerce into countries which had no such works.
When this taste created a big demand, the merchants naturally tried to establish the same manufactures in their own country to save transportation costs. Hence, the origin of the first manufactures for distant sale that were established in Western Europe after the fall of the Roman empire. No large country ever did or could subsist without some manufacturing industry.</description>

      <description>The division of labour must always be proportioned to the extent of commerce.
If 10 people only want a certain commodity, its manufacture will never be as divided as one that had 1,000 wanting it. The division of labour always becomes more perfect by the easy method of transportation in a country. The progress of commerce must be stopped if the road:
 is infested with robbers, and is deep and transportation is not easy.</description>

After the expulsion of the kings, the government became aristocratical: the patrician families only, obtained all the employments and dignities in the * state, and consequently all † honours civil and military.
The patricians being determined to prevent, if possible, the return of the kings, endeavoured to soment the restless principles which now prevailed in the minds of the people; but they did more than they would willingly have done: by attempting to inspire them with a hatred for kings, they fired them with an inordinate thirst for liberty.</description>

      <description>1 Utility is one of the principal sources of beauty.
A house&amp;rsquo;s convenience gives regular pleasure to the spectator. He is as much hurt when he sees its inconvenience, such as: windows of different shapes, or the door in a wrong place. The fitness of any system or machine for its intended purpose gives a certain propriety and beauty on the whole. It renders its very thought agreeable.
2 David Hume has recently answered most deeply, clearly, eloquently, and elegantly why utility pleases.</description>

      <description>Romantic love is natural but is not commonly expressed because it might be odious or ridiculous 15 The habitual feelings from the imagination are perfectly natural. But they are little sympathized with because other people might not have the same habits to be able to sympathize with them. Thus, such passions are always somewhat ridiculous.
An example is strong romantic attachment. We are unable to imagine what lovers experience, so we are not as eager as they are.</description>

      <description>How was the allodial government overturned to give way to the feudal system?
These great lords were continually making war on one another. In order to secure their tenants&#39; attendance, they gave them leases of the lands which they possessed from year to year. They afterwards came to be held for life.
The great lords usually engaged in very hazardous enterprises with their vassals. They extended this right to the land to their son and grandson&amp;rsquo;s life so that:</description>

      <description>Antecdent to the above-mentioned laws are those of nature.
 They get their force entirely from our frame and existence. To know these laws, we must see man before the establishment of society.  The laws received in such a state would be those of nature. The most natural law is to love the Creator, though it is not the first in sequence.
Man, in a state of nature, would have the faculty of knowing before he had acquired any knowledge.</description>

      <description>THE Romans were engaged in several wars against the Gauls: a thirst of glory, a contempt of death, and an inflexible resolution of conquering, were equal in both nations, but the weapons they used were different; the bucklers of the latter was small, and their swords [19] unfit for execution; and, indeed, the Gauls were cut to pieces by the Romans, much after the same manner as the Mexicans, in these latter ages, by the Spaniards; and a surprizing circumstance is, that though these people were combating perpetually with the Romans, they yet suffered themselves to be destroyed one after another, without their ever being sensible of, enquiring after, or obviating the cause of their calamities.</description>

      <description>SUCH was the distribution of the three p= owers in Rome. But they were far from being thus distributed in the provinc= es: liberty prevailed in the center, and tyranny in the extreme parts.
While Rome extended her dominions no far= ther than Italy, the people were governed as confederates, and the laws of = each republic were preserved. But, when she enlarged her conquests, and the= senate had no longer an immediate inspection over the provinces, nor the m= agistrates residing at Rome were any longer capable of governing the empire= , they were obliged to send pr=C3=A6tors and proconsuls.</description>

      <description>Christianity was established when the empire was declining. The Christians reproached the Pagans for that decay. The Pagans retorted the charge on Christiantiy.
The Christians replied that Dioclesian ruined the empire, by associating his three colleagues because each emperor would be as expensive, and maintained as great armies as could have subsisted had there been but one sovereign.
As a consequence, those who furnished the contributions being unequally proportioned to the number of the receivers, the charges became so excessive that the lands were forsaken by the husbandmen, and for want of cultivation lay waste, and were covered with wild and barren forests.</description>

      <description>How does commerce influence the people&amp;rsquo;s manners?
Whenever commerce is introduced into any country, probity and punctuality always accompany it. These virtues are almost unknown in a rude and barbarous country.
Of all the European nations, the Dutch are:
 the most commercial, and the most faithful to their word.  The English are more so than the Scotch, but much inferior to the Dutch.
In the remote parts of Britain, they are far less so than in its commercial parts.</description>

 Custom and fashion can make any physical thing agreeable, no matter how absurd. But custom and fashion can never make a character like Nero or Claudius agreeable  Nero will always be dreaded and hated. Claudius will always be scorned and derided.</description>

2 When two objects have frequently been seen together, the imagination acquires a habit of passing easily from the one to the other. If the first appears, we assume that the second will follow. They naturally put us in mind of one another and our attention glides easily along them.</description>

But in a popular state, virtue is necessary. This is confirmed unanimously by historians and is extremely agreeable to the nature of things.
A leader of a popular government needs virtue more than a monarch who can execute the laws by himself. A monarch can fix his mistakes by himself.</description>

Hugh Capet was chief justiciary. He got the government into his hands, but took only the title of the King of France.

      <description>THE monarchies that we know do not have liberty for their direct view. The only aim is the glory of:
 the subject, the state, and the sovereign.  But from hence there results a spirit of liberty, which, in those states, is capable of archieving as great things, and of contributing as much, perhaps, to happiness, as liberty itself.
Here the three powers are not distributed and founded on the model of the constitution above-mentioned: they have each a particular distribution, according to which they border more or less on political liberty; and, if they did not border upon it, monarchy would degenerate into despotic government.</description>

      <description>Thus, we have found the desired natures. How are they to be reared and educated? This education can prevent injustice from growing in States.  The State Should Censor Immoral and Untruthful Literature and Arts We shall do this by story-telling, and our story shall be the education of our heroes. The best education is traditional education, which is made up of: - Gymnastics for the body, and - Music and literature, both true and false, for the soul.</description>

      <description>This excess of taxes helped the Muslims carry on their conquests.
 The people were subjected to a simple tribute, paid and collected with ease. They were far happier in obeying a barbarous nation than a corrupt government that enslaved them.  Chapter 17: Troop Increase The Muslim conquest induced our princes to keep up an exorbitant number of troops. As soon as one prince augments his forces, the others do the same.</description>

Cheapness is the same thing with plenty. Water is so cheap because it is so plentiful. Diamonds are so dear because of their scarcity (Their real use seems not yet discovered).
To ascertain the most proper method of obtaining these conveniences, we should:
 consider what are the natural wants of mankind which are to be supplied, show wherein opulence consists.</description>

 the nature of government, its different forms, what circumstances gave occasion for it, and how it is maintained.  There are three forms of government:
 Monarchical - the supreme power is vested in one who can do what he pleases, make peace and war, impose taxes, etc. [tyranny] Aristocratical - the state is run by magistrates chosen by a class of people, such as the wealthy or known families, [oligarchy + aristocracy] Democratical - the state is run by the people together [democracy]  Aristocratical and democratical governments may be called republican.</description>

      <description>The absurd notion that national opulence consists in money has another bad effect &amp;ndash; it makes people think that whatever people spend locally cannot reduce public opulence.
Dr. Mandeville created a system that private vices are public benefits. It believes that what we spend at home is all spent among ourselves and that none of it goes out of the country.
But if everyone wears, tears, and spends his stock, without doing any industry, then the nation is made so much the poorer at the end of the year.</description>

 In an uncivilized nation where labour is undivided, everything is provided for by the natural needs of mankind.
Yet, when the nation is cultivated and labour divided, a more liberal provision is allotted them. This is how a common day-labourer in Britain has more luxury than an Indian sovereign.</description>

 is fitter and abler to take care of himself than of any other person, and feels his own pleasures and pains more sensibly than those of others.  His own sensations are his original sensations. These are the substance.
The sensations of others are the reflected or sympathetic images of those sensations.</description>

We are most mortified to:
 expose our distress in public, and feel that no one conceives half of what we suffer.  We pursue riches and avoid poverty chiefly from this regard to mankind&amp;rsquo;s sentiments.</description>

      <description>7 The power of the ancient barons was founded on the great proprietors&#39; authority over their tenants and retainers.
 They became the judges in peace and the leaders in war of all who dwelt on their estates. They could maintain order and execute the law within their respective demesnes.  Each of them could turn the whole force of the people against the injustice of anyone.
No other persons had sufficient authority to do this.</description>

Some people say that all our feelings arise from self-love. They think:
 that our pleasure and pain from fellow-feeling come from self love that man always needs the assistance of others, and this is why:  he rejoices whenever others adopt his own passions, as it ensures him of that assistance.</description>

      <description>14 The point of propriety is the degree of any passion which the impartial spectator approves of. This point is differently situated in different passions.
 In some passions, the excess is less disagreeable than the shortage.
 In such passions, the point of propriety seems to stand high, or nearer to the excess than to the shortage.
 In other passions, the shortage is less disagreeable than the excess.</description>

1 In Parts 1 and 2, I explained the origin and foundation of our judgments on the feelings and conduct of others. I will now explain the origin of our judgments on our own feelings and conduct.
2 We use sympathy to judge both the conduct of ourselves and that of other people.
 We judge another man&amp;rsquo;s conduct according to how we sympathize with his feelings. We judge our own conduct according to how we sympathize with our own feelings from another man&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint.</description>

      <description>10-12 The gratitude and resentment that I mention is the natural gratitude and resentment and not the fake one.
13 We sympathize with the joy of our loved ones when in prosperity. When we see one man assisted, protected, relieved by another, our sympathy with the beneficiary&amp;rsquo;s joy animates our fellow-feeling with his gratitude to his benefactor. We therefore readily sympathize with his gratitude and applaud the returns he makes to his benefactor.</description>

      <description>THE public revenues are a portion that each subject gives of his property, in order to secure or enjoy the remainder.
To fix these revenues properly, the necessities of the state and those of the subject should be considered.
Imaginary wants are those which flow from the passions and the weakness of the governors. This arises from:
 the vain conceit of some extraordinary project, the inordinate desire of glory, a certain impotence of mind incapable of withstanding the impulse of fancy.</description>

      <description>Laws generally are the necessary relations arising from the nature of things. In this sense, all beings have their laws.
 The Deity has his laws. The material world has its laws. Animals have their laws. Humans have their laws, created by their intelligence.  Some people assert absurdly that the various effects in this world were spontaneously produced by a blind fatality.
But this blind fatality cannot create intelligent beings.</description>

      <description>What is the duty of the sovereign? What is the proper punishment of disobedience?
Every attempt to overturn this power is considered as the greatest crime in every nation. It is called high treason. There is a great difference between treason in monarchies and treason in republics.
 In monarchies, treason is an attempt on the king. In republics, treason is an attempt on the people&amp;rsquo;s liberties.  This is why the maxim of assassination came to be established in republics, and not in monarchies.</description>

      <description>The limitations of the sovereign&amp;rsquo;s power It is impossible to be precise regarding this branch of public law. The duties of one subject to another are sufficiently ascertained by the laws of every country and the courts of justice. But there are no judges to determine when sovereigns do wrong. [No world government yet] To suppose a sovereign subject to judgement, supposes another sovereign.
In England it can be exactly ascertained when the king encroaches on the people&amp;rsquo;s privileges, or the people on the king&amp;rsquo;s privileges.</description>

      <description>The Origin of Free-Traders 1 After the fall of the Roman empire, the people of cities and towns were not more favoured than those of the countryside. They were very different from the first inhabitants of the ancient Greek and Italian republics.
Those of Greece and Italy were composed chiefly of the proprietors of lands. They built their houses near each other with a wall for common defence.
After the fall of the Roman empire, those proprietors lived in castles on their own estates in the midst of their own tenants and dependants.</description>

They judged that it would be necessary to arm the soldiers who composed the legion with weapons whether offensive or defensive, of a stronger and † heavier kind than those of any other nation.</description>

      <description>Now comes the third trial. A sage* whispers to me that the pleasure of the wise is true and pure. All others are a shadow only. Surely this is the greatest and most decisive of falls? Pleasure is opposed to pain. There is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain. It is intermediate, and a rest of the soul between either. Sick people say that nothing is more pleasant than health.</description>

      <description>MONARCHIES have more complex laws than despotic governments because monarchies need courts of judicature which decide on cases.
The decisions must be preserved and learnt so that:
 we may judge in the same manner to-day as yesterday the lives and property of the citizens may be as certain and fixed  In monarchies, the administration of justice decides:
 whatever belongs to life and property and honour  This creates the demand for very scrupulous enquiries.</description>

      <description>Chapter 21: The Clemency of the Prince CLEMENCY is the characteristic of monarchs. In republics, whose principle is virtue, it is not so necessary.
In despotic governments, where fear predominates, it is less customary, because the great men are to be restrained by examples of severity. It is more necessary in monarchies, where they are governed by honour, which frequently requires what the very law forbids. Disgrace is here equivalent to chastisement; and even the forms of justice are punishments.</description>

      <description>The Amiable Virtues are Social Feelings 29 A divided sympathy makes anger and resentment so disagreeable. The social and benevolent feelings are opposite to these. They cause a redoubled sympathy which almost always render them agreeable.
The indifferent observer is almost always pleased with:
 Generosity Humanity Kindness Compassion Mutual friendship Esteem  The observer&amp;rsquo;s sympathy with the subject-person generating those feelings exactly coincides with his sympathy for the object-person who is receiving those feelings.</description>

      <description>Chapter 1: How Commerce Improves and Corrupts Morals Commerce is a cure for the most destructive prejudices.
 whereever we find agreeable manners, there commerce flourishes wherever there is commerce, there we meet with agreeable manners.  Our manners are now less savage because of commerce. It has everywhere diffused a knowledge of the manners of all nations. These are compared one with another, and from this comparison arise the greatest advantages.</description>

      <description>UNDER the consulate of Acilius Glabrio and Piso, the Acilian law was made to prevent the intriguing for places.
Dio says that the senate engaged the consuls to propose it, by reason that C. Cornelius, the tribune, had resolved to cause more severe punishments to be established against this crime; to which the people seemed greatly inclined.
The senate rightly judged, that immoderate punishments would strike indeed a terror into people’s minds, but must have also this effect, that there would be nobody afterwards to accuse or condemn; whereas, by proposing moderate penalties, there would be always judges and accusers.</description>

      <description>I IMAGINE Hannibal did not abound in witticisms, especially in favour of Fabius and Marcellus against himself. I am sorry to see Livy strew his flowers on these enormous colossuses of antiquity: I wish he had done like Homer, who neglects embellishing them, and knew so well how to put them in motion.
Besides, what Hannibal is made to speak, ought to have common sense: but if, on hearing the defeat of his brother, he said publicly, that it was the prelude of the ruin of Carthage; could any thing have a greater tendency to drive to despair a people, who had placed their confidence in him, and to discourage an army which expected such high recompences after the war?</description>

      <description>The first proof of happiness is the rankings of the States:  the royal timocratical oligarchical democratical tyrannical.  This is the order of their virtue as well. The son of Ariston (the best) has decided that:
 the best and justest is also the happiest. This is he who is the most royal man and king over himself, the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable. This is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his State.</description>

      <description>The true philosophers have knowledge, while the false philosophers only have opinion. Only true philosophers are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable. Those philosophers who are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our State should be our guardians. The following people are simply blind, those who:
 lack the knowledge of the true being of each thing, have no clear pattern in their souls, are unable as with a painter&#39;s eye to look at the absolute truth and repair to the original, are unable to have a perfect vision of the other world, order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice, and guard and preserve their order.</description>

      <description>Last of all comes the tyrannical man. We must determine the nature and number of the appetites first. Everyone has the unnecessary pleasures and appetites which I think are unlawful. But in some persons, they are controlled by the laws and by reason. The better desires prevail over them—either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak. While in the case of others they are more and are stronger.</description>

      <description>Hatred, Anger, and Resentment 21 Hatred and resentment must always be regulated before we can enter into them.
Our sympathy with them is divided between:
 its subject, or the person who feels them, and its object, or the person whom he is angry at.  The interests of these two are directly opposite.
 Our sympathy with the subject-person would prompt us to wish for fear.  Our sympathy with him is less than the anger which he feels:  because all sympathetic passions are inferior to the original ones, and beause of our opposite sympathy with the object-person.</description>

Everyone in society needs each other&amp;rsquo;s assistance and protection. The society flourishes and is happy if the necessary assistance is reciprocally afforded from love, gratitude, friendship, and esteem. All its members are:</description>

      <description>Amidst the general confusion of affairs, Phocas became unsettled in his new dignity. Heraclius came from Africa and murdered him and found the provinces invaded and the legions destroyed.
As soon as he remedied these disasters, the Arabians extended the Islamic empire founded by Mohammed.
No people ever made so rapid a progress. They immediately conquered Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Africa, and then turned against the Persians.
God permitted his religion to be laid low, in so many places where it once had been predominant; not that it now ceased to be the object of his providential care, but because it always either in its state of glory or depression produces its natural effect, which is the sanctification of the soul.</description>

The soil of every country is commonly possessed by the natives. The laws of most states render foreigners unwilling to purchase their lands; Only the presence of the owner improves them: this kind of riches therefore belongs to every state in particular. But moveable effects, as money, notes, bills of exchange, stocks in companies, vessels, and all merchandises, belong to the whole world in general.</description>

 reward from gratitude, punish from resentment, protect our children&amp;rsquo;s helplessness, and afford support to the infirmities of our parents, from natural affection.  Instead, all feelings for objects should be extinguished in our breast.</description>

      <description>Socrates to Thrasymachus: Is the attempt to determine the way of man&#39;s life so small a matter to you? I do not believe that injustice is more gainful than justice, even if injustice is uncontrolled and allowed to have free play. If an unjust man can commit injustice by fraud or force, it still does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice. You should convince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice.</description>

      <description>Socrates: I think that Periander, Perdiccas, Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban, or some other rich, proud, and mighty man, was the first to say that justice is &#34;doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies.&#34; But if this definition of justice also breaks down, what other can be offered?  Several times, Thrasymachus tried to get the argument into his own hands. He had been put down by the rest of the company.</description>

      <title>Economic Development From Zero via Adam Smith</title>

      <description>Update Apr 2021: This post was made in 2015 because the model predicted a huge crisis starting in 2019 that could eventually collapse some societies.
 The main advantage of Pantrynomics over Economics is that it is based on the dynamics of the human mind as explained by David Hume which was later applied by Adam Smith into his Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations.
To David Hume and Eastern philosophy, the mind is a metaphysical thing, different from the physical brain.</description>

      <description>The core flaw of Economics, which is also the source of the unsustainability of &amp;ldquo;economic&amp;rdquo; systems, is that it focuses on utility or pleasure from external objects as their ultimate goals. According to Adam Smith, this is wrong because utility is merely the effect of existence and is part of the deception of Nature (which in Eastern Philosophy is called Maya).
It is this deception which rouses and keeps in continual motion the industry of mankind.</description>

      <description>People&amp;rsquo;s confusion regarding Smith&amp;rsquo;s works, such as his stand on capitalism, arises because he did not define nor explain self-interest, private ownership, and why a person should have the profits of one&amp;rsquo;s own work.
It is but equity that those who feed, clothe and lodge the the people, should have such a share* of the produce of their own labour  Capitalism violates the concept of profit-sharing by giving all the profits* to the investor or owner.</description>

      <description>Summary: We define Capitalism as an economic system that uses outside ownership to amass private profits.
 A major topic of debate among economists is whether Adam Smith was a proponent of capitalism.
We argue that he was not, simply because his core ideas are very different from those of capitalism, which is merely mercantilism with superficial changes. The source of the confusion is the unclear definition of the word &amp;lsquo;capitalism&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <guid>https://superphysics.one/fallacies/economics/profit-maximization-is-absurd/</guid>
      <description>A key fallacy that is inseparably part of Economics, along with equilibrium, is the idea of profit maximization.
The idea of maximization has its origins in Newton&amp;rsquo;s Calculus which in turn has its origins in Physics. Smith and Hume never mentioned maximization nor calculus anywhere in their writings on the political economy. In fact, The Wealth of Nations has no equations at all*!
 *Instead of equality, equilibrium, equations, or 1 + 1 = 2, Smith makes extensive use of ratios, proportions, balance, or 2 : 2, as prices are psychological and not physical in nature.</description>

      <description>To prove the sophistry of capitalism, we must trace the roots of its core ideas. Among its core ideas is the production motive, or the sophistical belief that what is good for the producers or sellers, or those who live by profits, is good for the nation. This is in contrast to the consumption motive espoused by Adam Smith.
The production motive is best seen in Say&amp;rsquo;s Law which says that production is the cause of demand.</description>

      <description>The Economist showed an interesting graphic of the correlation of skyscrapers and economic crises in a phenomenon known as the Skyscraper Curse. A question was posed: &amp;ldquo;Does this frenzy of building augur badly for the world economy?&amp;rdquo;, to which we answer &amp;ldquo;Yes, because of Economics&amp;rdquo;.
To explain why skyscraper booms are generally bad, we explain their nature using our Dialectical method, or by finding out the metaphysical causes to physical economic effects, as used by David Hume and Adam Smith.</description>

      <description>-- We can use our DCTI tool to analyze the Greek crisis to prove that the current solutions of austerity and high taxes are not the best ones. Such solutions are are a relic of the mercantile way of thinking of an economy as a business, instead of, naturally, as a society, family, or group of friends. The proper solution will involve the whole EU and will help the union stay together*.</description>

      <description>Adam Smith gave four maxims on taxation in The Wealth of Nations that have been largely forgotten today. Taxes should be fair, non-arbitrary, cost-effective and convenient.
1: People should contribute towards supporting their government in proportion to their respective abilities The rich or those who have the ability topay more should pay more than those who are less able to. Smith&amp;rsquo;s pro-poor taxation policies are found in Book 5, Chapter 2, and are as clear as day:</description>

      <description>Adam Smith wrote the Wealth of Nations as an attack on Mercantilism which has since evolved into Neoclassical Economics. Despite his attack, it&amp;rsquo;s very strange for him to entrust an entire country&amp;rsquo;s external trade to foreign merchants:
If the society has insufficient capital to cultivate all its lands and to completely process all its rude produce, there is even a big advantage that its rude produce should be exported by a foreign capital.</description>

      <description>13 In Great Britain, the land and malt taxes are regularly anticipated every year by a borrowing clause.
This clause is constantly inserted into the acts which impose those taxes. The Bank of England advances to government the total amount of those taxes at 3-8% interest. It receives payment as the taxes come in. Any deficiency is offset by the tax proceeds of the next year. The only remaining unmortgaged public revenue is thus spent before it comes in.</description>

      <description>Superiority of Armies vs Militia 27 History shows the superiority of a well-regulated standing army over a militia.
28 The army of Philip of Macedon is one of the first standing armies documented. In the beginning, his troops were probably a militia. Frequent wars with the Thracians, Illyrians, Thessalians, and some Greek cities near Macedon gradually formed his troops to the exact discipline of a standing army. He was careful not to disband that army when he was at peace, which was very seldom.</description>

      <description>130 The educational institutions for the youth may generate a revenue sufficient for defraying their own expence.
The fee or honorary which the scholar pays the teacher is naturally a revenue of this kind.
131 Even if the teacher&amp;rsquo;s reward does not come from this natural revenue, it still is unnecessary that it should be derived from the society&amp;rsquo;s general revenue.
In most countries, the collection and application of the society&amp;rsquo;s general revenue is done through the executive power.</description>

Church services and the Bible translations read in churches were both in that corrupted Latin. After demise of the Roman empire, Latin gradually ceased to be the language of Europe.

The demand for labour This demand requires an increasing, stationary, or declining population. It regulates the worker&amp;rsquo;s subsistence, whether liberal, moderate, or scanty. The ordinary or average price of goods This determines the amount of money which must be paid to the worker for his subsistence.
While the demand for labour and the price of goods remain the same, a direct tax on wages raises wages higher than the tax.</description>

 Capitation taxes Taxes on consumable commodities  These must be paid indifferently from rent, wages, or profits.
Capitation Taxes 139 Capitation taxes* become arbitrary if it is proportioned to the fortune or revenue of each taxpayer.
A man&amp;rsquo;s fortune varies daily. Without an intolerable annual inquisition, it can only be guessed at. His assessment must depend on the good or bad humour of his assessors.</description>

      <description>The History of Customs Duties 165 Customs duties are much more ancient than excise duties.
They were called &amp;lsquo;customs&amp;rsquo; to denote customary payments which used from time immemorial. They were originally taxes on merchants&#39; profits. During the times of feudal anarchy, merchants were: a little better than emancipated bondmen, despised like all other burgh inhabitants. Merchants&#39; gains were envied. The nobility consented that the king should tallage the profits of: their own tenants, and the merchants who they were not interested in protecting.</description>

      <description>215 In France, the different revenue laws in the different provinces require many revenue officers to:
 prevent the importation of certain goods, or subject imported goods to certain duties.  These interrupt France&amp;rsquo;s interior commerce.
Some provinces are allowed to compound for the gabelle or salt-tax. Others are exempted from it altogether. Some provinces are exempted from the exclusive sale of tobacco The farmers-general enjoy this exemption through most of France.</description>

      <description>190 In Great Britain, liquors for private use are not liable to any excise duties.
This exemption aims to save private families from the tax-gatherer&amp;rsquo;s odious visit. It causes those duties to fall much lighter on the rich than the poor. Distilling for private use is not very common. But in the countryside, many middle class and almost all rich families brew their own beer. Their strong beer costs them 96 pence a barrel less than it costs the common brewer.</description>

He called savage and barbaric ones as rude:
A rude society has more variety in individual occupations. but less variety when all occupations are taken together. Every man does almost everything which any other man does. Every man has a considerable degree of knowledge, ingenuity, and invention, but no one has a great degree of them.</description>

 the proprietors of land, and the owners or employers of capital stock.  55 The proprietor of land is interested to keep his estate in as good condition as he can, for the sake of his own revenue.</description>

91 The commerce done with uncivilized nations needs extraordinary protection.
An ordinary counting-house gives little security to the goods of the merchants trading to the African west coast. Their warehouses should be fortified against the barbarous natives. The Indian government&amp;rsquo;s disorders rendered such fortifications necessary even among that mild and gentle people. The English and French East India Companies were allowed to build their first forts in India under pretence of securing their persons and property from violence.</description>

Adam Smith would categorize it as a policy by poor and austere societies:
In every civilized society which has the distinction of ranks, there were always two systems of morality: the strict or austere which is generally admired and revered by the common people, and the liberal or loose system which is commonly adopted by people of fashion.</description>

 transfer his share to another person, introduce a new member into the company.  Upon proper warning, each member may:
 withdraw from the copartnery, and demand payment for his share of the common stock from the copartnery.</description>

      <description>14 Land is a fund more naturally stable and permanent.
The rent of public lands was the main source of the public revenue of many great nations above the shepherd state. The ancient Greek and Italian republics derived most of the government revenue from the rent of public lands. The ancient European sovereigns for a long time derived their revenue from the rent of the crown lands.  15 War and the preparation for war create most of the expence of all great modern states.</description>

      <description>68 The revenue might be very much increased without increasing the burden on the people through:
 a more equal land-tax, a more equal tax on house rents, and changes in the current customs and excise system, as those mentioned in (Chapter 2n)  It would distribute the burden more equally on all. This increase would not totally liberate the public revenue.

      <description>147 The impossibility of taxing people according to their revenue by any capitation led to the invention of taxes on consumable commodities.
The state, not knowing how to directly and proportionally tax the revenue of its subjects, taxes it indirectly by taxing their expence. Their expence is supposed to be proportional to their revenue. It is taxed by taxing the consumable commodities that they buy.

They are finally paid by the landlord even if they are originally paid by the farmer. When a part of the produce is paid as tax, the farmer computes the yearly value of that part.
 He makes a proportional abatement in the rent to pay to the landlord. All farmers compute beforehand what the yearly church tithe will amount to.</description>

The 23rd of George 2nd chapter 31 established this company.
It had two objects:
 To restrain the oppressive and monopolizing spirit natural to the directors of a regulated company, andand To force them to be attentive in maintaining forts and garrisons, something unnatural to them.  At first, it was expressly charged with the maintenance of all the British forts and garrisons between Cape Blanc and the Cape of Good Hope.</description>

It traded as a regulated company in its first 12 voyages to India. It had separate stocks only in the general ships of the company. In 1612, it united into a joint stock. Its charter was not confirmed by act of parliament and conveyed an exclusive privilege. For many years, it was not much disturbed by interlopers.</description>

They discovered ways of spending their whole revenues on their own persons without sharing with other people. Their charity became gradually less extensive.</description>

A landed nation can raise its own artificers, manufacturers, and merchants best by granting the most perfect freedom of trade to the artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of all other nations. It raises the value of its own surplus produce. Its continual increase gradually establishes a fund which raises up all the artificers, manufacturers, and merchants that it needs.

Their necessary expence is much smaller.

      <description>Adam Smith said that the differences in wages are due to five factors (agreeableness, trust, constancy, risk, cost of learning) and 3 states (backward, stationary, advancing).
In contrast, David Ricardo simplistically said that wages are based on the supply and demand of workers and the cost of goods and services which wages are spent on. Because of this simplicity, Ricardo concluded that wages must fall (Iron Law of Wages). This is similar to that or Marx, who was also very simplistic.</description>

1. Local or Home Trade This is the trade done within a nation&amp;rsquo;s borders. This generally supports the most people. Ancient and Medieval China was able to sustain itself with local trade alone.
2. Direct Foreign Trade 3. Indirect or Roundabout Foreign Trade Of course, no country can do everything by itself, that’s why Smith wrote:
The most round-about foreign trade of consumption therefore may be as necessary as the most direct foreign trade in terms of supporting the productive labour of the country and the value of its produce.</description>

      <description>Adam Smith would be against Brexit because the European Union (EU)is an internal free trade zone and Britain derives a lot of benefits from it.
However, this does not mean that Smith would be pro-EU, because while there is free trade within it, there are oppressive regulations and subsidies that make it hard for outsiders and outside trade to penetrate fortress Europe.
Rather, Smith would be for a World Union (WU) where all countries have free trade and immigration with each other.</description>

A society, whether it be a family, corporation, or country, is wealthy if its productivity or value produced exceeds its own demand or value needed. This productivity is shown in the “Industry” column below, while the demand is shown in the “Demand” column. A society is wealthy if its Industry bars are higher than its Demand bars and poor if it is lower.</description>

      <description>how to prevent stagnation
&amp;ldquo;In a country fully peopled.. the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be employed.</description>

      <description>SECTION 2 THE MEDIUM OF CIRCULATION
A. The Metamorphosis of Commodities
We saw in a former chapter that the exchange of commodities implies contradictory and mutually exclusive conditions. The differentiation of commodities into commodities and money does not sweep away these inconsistencies, but develops a modus vivendi, a form in which they can exist side by side. This is generally the way in which real contradictions are reconciled. For instance, it is a contradiction to depict one body as constantly falling towards another, and as, at the same time, constantly flying away from it.</description>

      <description>Symptoms Physical weakness, acidic or watery belching, dizziness, burning stomach, heartburn
Cause Oxygen inhaled in breathing enters the body and eventually turns into carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide activates the digestive fluid-secreting glands.
It becomes impossible for the digestive fluid to digest the food properly when:
 food is taken irregularly and excessively day after day food is forced down with little or no appetite eating rich food becomes a steady habit  The undigested food turns into poisonous gas and the secreted digestive fluid gradually turns into harmful acid.</description>

      <description>Symptoms Swelling of the appendix and simultaneous unbearable pain in the abdominal region; fear of eating in spite of appetite or desire for food.
Causes Aversion to physical labour, spending much time indoors, not taking part in sports and exercises, constipation; such short-comings, along with overeating.
Treatment Ásanas, mudrás, diet and dos and don’ts are the same as for dyspepsia patients. With appendicitis, fibrous foods, all types of non-vegetarian foods, atapa rice (a fine-quality, very white type of rice) and all foods that cause constipation are strictly forbidden.</description>

      <description>The Essassani are a 5th dimensional civilization which is based on unconditional love, ecstasy, fun, following your excitement, being totally non-judgmental, and giving validity and equality to the uniqueness of each individual in their society*.
 *Superphysics note: Superhysics is based on David Hume&amp;rsquo;s maxim that mentality creates reality. This is how the Essassani maxims, such as &amp;lsquo;believing is seeing&amp;rsquo; caught our attention. However, no one seems to be keen enough to notice that their principles are designed for 5th dimensional beings and not 4th dimensional ones like humans.</description>

      <description>19 Therefore, there were three kinds of breaches of moral duty which came before the confessor&amp;rsquo;s tribunal, and fell under the casuists&#39; awareness.
20
  Breaches of the rules of justice   These rules are all express and positive. Their violation is naturally attended with:
 the consciousness of deserving punishment and the dread of suffering punishment from God and man.  21
 Breaches of the rules of chastity   In all grosser instances, these are real breaches of the rules of justice.</description>

      <description>THE danger is not when the state passes from one moderate to another moderate government, (as from Edition: current; Page: [151] a republic to a monarchy, or from a monarchy to a republic,) but when it precipitates fro m a moderate to a despotic government.
Most of the European nations are still g overned by the principles of morality. But if, from a long abuse of power, or the fury of conquest, despotic sway should prevail to a certain degree, neither morals nor climate would be able to withstand its baleful influence : and then human nature would be exposed, for some time at least, even in t his beautiful part of the world, to the insults with which she has been abu sed in the other three.</description>

      <description>An important feature of Smith&amp;rsquo;s Political Economy (and the science of Pantrynomics which we created from it) is the classification ofall revenue into either rent, wages, and profit.
Such classification is not so important to Economics which focuses on the quantity or dollar value of revenue instead of its quality. This classification is difficult nowadays when other kinds of revenue have been introduced, such as interest income, different kinds of taxes, royalties, revenue from membership fees, etc.</description>

      <description>Symptoms Repeated need to defecate but small movement, urge to strain while defecating, pain in the navel region, etc. Causes: Undigested half-cooked or uncooked meat or pulses or such things, when mixed with contaminated air in the stomach, cause an abnormal reaction in the intestine, and when the pitta, in spite of its best efforts, fails to digest these things, they come out in the form of loose movement. But if this loose movement does not take its natural course, then those materials start to decompose inside the colon in an ugly way, and begin to decay the mucous membrane.</description>

 every new tax creates a new ability in the subject to bear it each encrease of public burdens proportionally encreases the people&amp;rsquo;s industry  This maxim is most likely to be abused. It is so much more dangerous, because it cannot be denied. It has some foundation in reason and experience when kept within certain bounds.

      <description>Free competition does not mean the competitors need to be equal. Instead, the freedom of each competitor needs to be guaranteed by the government. For example, the competitors in a beauty contest might not be equal in height, weight, skin color, or hair length, etc. Nevertheless, their freedom to be in the competition, to wear their costumes, show their skills, answer questions, should be guaranteed by the organizers.
This guarantee of freedom in commercial competition was removed by French economist JB Say through the concept of laissez faire from the Physiocrats which he corrupted to mean total deregulation.</description>

      <description>Symptoms “Developed piles” happens when contaminated gas and blood cannot get out of the body. This causes pressure on the veins and capillaries around the anus which becomes swollen. “External piles” are those outside the anus. &amp;ldquo;Internal piles&amp;rdquo; are those inside the anus.
“Bleeding piles” happen when blood oozes out of the developed piles under pressure of the Apána Váyu (vital energy controlling the lower abdominal organs).
“Dry piles” are piles which do not bleed but are instead painful, aching, burning or itching.</description>

      <description>Symptoms When undigested food builds up offensive internal gas puts a severe strain on the intestine which gets dislodged from its normal position. It opens a hold in the abdominal wall, and protrudes through it.
“Inguinal hernia” is the dislodged intestine coming out through an opening left in the canal to the scrotum.
“Femoral hernia” happens if it pushes out through the hole in the canal of nerve fibres and the muscular network controlling the legs.</description>

      <description>Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s philosophy was carried to the west. It pleased the subtile geniuses, who were the virtuosi of those times of ignorance.
The theologians condemned the Jewish notions of lending at interest absolutely and in all cases. Hence commerce, which was the profession only of mean persons, became that of knaves, because whenever a thing is forbidden, which nature permits or necessity requires, those who do it are looked upon as dishonest.</description>

Despotic governments do it by separating, and by keeping themselves single. They sacrifice a part of the country; and, by rav aging and desolating the frontiers, they render the heart of the empire inaccessible. This practice is more tolerable in large than in middling states.
A despotic government does all the mischief to itself that could be committed by a strong, cruel enemy.</description>

 Everything in the world is purchased by labour. The only cause of our labour are our passions. When a nation abounds in manufactures and mechanic arts, the proprietors of land and the farmers study agriculture as a science. They redouble their industry and attention.
The superfluity from their labour is exchanged with manufactures now coveted by men’s luxury.</description>

      <description>Introduction
1 After the inquiry on the nature of virtue, the next important question in Moral Philosophy is about the principle of approbation. The principle of approbation is the power of the mind which renders certain characters agreeable or disagreeable to us. It makes us:
 prefer one tenour of conduct to another, denominate the one right and the other wrong, consider the one kind of conduct as the object of approbation, honour, and reward, and consider the other kind of conduct as the object of blame, censure, and punishment.</description>

 that all general maxims in politics should be established with great caution that irregular and extraordinary appearances are frequently discovered in the moral and physical world  1.

      <description>46 The Stoics believed that those who had not attained perfect virtue might have some proficiency in virtue. They organized those proficiencies into different classes, according to their level of advancement. They called the imperfect virtues not as rectitudes, but as proprieties, fitnesses, decent and becoming actions.
 Cicero called these officia. Seneca more exactly called them convenientia  Cicero&amp;rsquo;s Offices wrote about the doctrine of those imperfect, but attainable virtues as &amp;lsquo;the practical morality of the Stoics&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Public incontinence is the inseparable companion of luxury.
If we leave the motions of the heart at liberty, how shall we be able to restrain the weaknesses of the mind?
At Rome, besides the general institutions, the censors prevailed on the magistrates to enact several particular laws for maintaining the frugality of women. This was the design of the Fannian, Licinian, and Oppian laws.
In Livy, the great ferment the senate was in when the women insisted upon the revocation of the Oppian law.</description>

      <description>I shall not be able to make myself right ly understood, till the reader has perused the four following chapters.
Chapter 16: Distinctive Properties of a Republic IT is natural for a republic to have only a small territory. Otherwise, it cannot long subsist.
In a large republic, there are wealthy men of less moderation. there are trusts too considerable to be placed in any single subject; he has interests of his own; he soon begins to think that he may be happy and gl orious by oppressing his fellow-citizens; and that he may raise himself to grandeur on the ruins of his country.</description>

      <description>17 Moral systems based on feelings can be divided into two classes.

  According to some, the principle of approbation is founded on a particular faculty of perception.   This is exerted by the mind at the view of actions or affections.
 Some actions affect this faculty agreeably and are stamped as right, laudable, and virtuous. Some actions affect it disagreeably and are stamped as wrong, blamable, and vicious.</description>

      <description>Hobbes&#39; Doctrine 8 Mr. Hobbes&#39; doctrine is that:
 a state of nature is a state of war before civil government was created, there could be no peaceful society  According to him, therefore:
 to preserve society was to support civil government to destroy civil government was to end society  But the existence of civil government depends on the obedience paid to the supreme magistrate. The moment he loses his authority, all government is ended.</description>

      <title>Systems which make Virtue consist in Benevolence</title>

      <description>72 The system which makes virtue consist in benevolence is very ancient, but not as ancient as those of the Greeks. It was the doctrine of most of the Eclectics, after the age of Augustus. They pretended to follow the opinions of Plato and Pythagoras. Thus, they are commonly known as Platonists.
73 According to them in the divine nature, benevolence or love was the sole principle of action which directed all the other attributes.</description>

      <description>55 Epicurus&#39; system is the most ancient one that renders virtue as prudence. His enemies allege him to have borrowed his philosophy&amp;rsquo;s leading principles from his predecessors, particularly from Aristippus. Despite this, it is very probable that at least his way of applying those principles was original.
56 According to him, bodily pleasure and pain were the sole ultimate objects of natural desire and aversion. These required no proof. Pleasure might sometimes be avoided because it might cause us to:</description>

      <title>The Coalition Of Parties</title>

      <description>In a free government, the abolition of all distinctions of party may not be practicable, perhaps not desirable, .
The only dangerous parties are those that aim to change the:
 essentials of government, succession of the crown, or considerable privileges of several members of the constitution  They prefer violence over compromise.
The parties in England had this animosity for over the last 100 years, which caused civil war sometimes.</description>

      <title>The Corruption of Democracy, Aristocracy, Monarchy</title>

      <description>The principle of democracy is corrupted when:
 the spirit of equality is extinct the spirit of extreme equality exists  The people would think that they are on a level with those who command them. They would then want to:
 manage everything themselves, debate for the senate, execute for the magistrate, and decide for the judges.  When this is the case, virtue can no longer subsist in the republic.</description>

      <description>Our missionaries inform us that:
 the Imperial Chinese government is admirable it has a proper mixture of fear, honour, and virtue.  Consequently, I must have given an idle distinction, in establishing the principles of the three governments.
But I cannot conceive what this honour can be, among a people who act only through fear of being bastinaded.
Our merchants* do not give us such accounts of the virtue so much talked of by the missionaries.</description>

      <description>The current increase in global warming and overpopulation is leading to more natural disasters on top of the depletion of resources. This causes people to look for alternative resource systems that are more sustainable. This in turn puts more non-mainstream economic proposals, both good and bad, to the public view. In this post, we shall discuss a bad proposal called the Steady State Economy.
What is the Steady State Economy? Its founder Herman Daly defines it as:</description>

      <description>Great Britain and Ireland, or any territory of equal extent would be divided into 100 counties. Each county has 100 districts, leading to 10,000 districts.
 Country A  County 1  District 1-1 District 1-2 .. District 1-100   County 2  District 2-1 District 2-2 .. District 2-100   County 3 .. County 100    If the country is smaller, we can reduce the number of counties, but never below 30.</description>

      <description>The Trade Between the Towns and the Countryside 1 The great commerce of every civilized society is the one done between the people of the town and those of the countryside.
It consists in the exchange of rude for manufactured produce either immediately as barter, or with money or some paper which represents money. The countryside supplies the town with food and raw materials.
The town repays this supply by sending back manufactured products.</description>

      <description>No party in the present age can support itself without philosophical principles annexed to its political or practical one.
Thus all factions in England have thought of speculative principles to protect and cover their scheme of actions.
The people are commonly very rude builders, especially in this speculative way. This is more true when actuated by party-zeal. Their projects become a little unshapely, with marks of that violence and hurry, in which it was raised.</description>

      <description>When the Protestant Succession was still uncertain during the reign of Queen Anne, A member of parliament asked which party he would choose.
He would easily perceive the great advantage resulting from the restoration of the Stuart family; by which we should preserve the succession clear and undisputed, free from a pretender, with such a specious title as that of blood, which, with the multitude, is always the claim, the strongest and most easily comprehended.</description>

      <title>The Questions in a Theory of Moral Sentiments</title>

      <description>1 Almost all of the remarkable theories on the nature of our moral feelings are partly correct and partly wrong due to their imperfect view of nature.
2 There are two questions regarding moral principles:
 What is their definition of virtue? What is the conduct that makes up the praise-worthy character?   This character is the natural object of esteem, honour, and approbation. By what faculty in the mind recommends this character to us?</description>

      <description>In human affairs, the discernment of what comes from chance and what comes from causes requires the most refinement. An author will likely deceive himself by false subtilties and refinements in this.
Any enquiry about an event is cut when we declare it to be derived from chance. It leaves the writer in the same state of ignorance with the rest of mankind. But when the event comes from certain and stable causes, he may then display his ingenuity in assigning these causes.</description>

      <title>The Spirit of extreme Equality</title>

      <description>AS distant as heaven is from earth, so is the true spirit of equality from that of extreme equality. The former does not imply that every body should command, or that no one should be commanded, but that we obey or command our equals. It endeavours not to shake off the authority of a master, but that its masters should be none but its equals.
In the state of nature, all men are born equal.</description>

      <description>The previous post pointed out that Smith was one of the few Western intellectuals to hint at the concept of dharma, or the natural and sustainable activities of humans, and apply it both for moral and economic purporses.
Instead of the word dharma, however, he named his concept the invisible hand. This had economic applications in The Wealth of Nations and moral applications in The Theory of Moral Sentiments.
Weaponizing the Invisible Hand The main difference between Smith&amp;rsquo;s invisible hand and Eastern dharma is that the former has moral, spiritual, and practical uses, while the latter emphasizes only its moral and spiritual use.</description>
