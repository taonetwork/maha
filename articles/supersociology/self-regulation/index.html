          <p>Many liberals advocate the self-regulation as an alternative to regulation by governments and institutions. They usually borrow passages from Adam Smith who said that the government should not lay its hand on the freedom of individuals to act as they see fit. They say that invisible hand of self-interest is much better at regulating the self:</p>
<div class="squote smith">
Every individual works to render the society’s annual revenue as great as he can. He generally does not intend to promote the public interest.. By preferring to support domestic industry over foreign industry, he intends only his own security. By directing that industry to produce the greatest value [for society], he intends only his own gain. In this case, as in many other cases, he is led by an invisible hand to promote an end which he did not intend. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it [the society] was no part of it [the goal]. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes the society’s interest more effectively than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation not very common among merchants.
<cite>Wealth Of Nations Book 4</cite>
</div>
<p>However, they fail to point out that before such self-interest is promoted, Smith advocated that fellow-feeling must be propagated first:</p>
<div class="squote smith">
the loss or gain of our own very small interest appears to be vastly more important to the selfish and original passions of human nature. <!-- It excites a more passionate joy, sorrow, desire, or aversion, than the greatest concern of another person who we are unconnected with. --> As long as they are surveyed from this station, his interests can never be put into the balance with our own, and restrain us from doing whatever promotes our own interest, no matter how ruinous to him.
<p>Before we can compare those opposite interests, we must change our position. We must view them neither from our own place nor from his, with our own eyes nor with his.
<cite>Theory of Moral Sentiments</cite></p>
</div>
<p>If fellow-feeling regulates self-interest, what regulates this fellow-feeling?</p>
<br>
<h3 id="self-regulation-through-the-conscience-and-the-common-interest">Self-regulation through the Conscience and the Common Interest</h3>
<p>This fellow-feeling is regulated by our conscience for personal situations, and the commmon interest for social situations. Adam Smith calls this conscience and commmon interest as impartial spectator which is located in the heart. In Hinduism, this matches the heart chakra which regulates human feelings:</p>
<div class="squote smith">
We are naturally interested with the events that affect our little selves the most. Our interest creates our feelings which are often too vehement. If they become too vehement, Nature's proper remedy is the real or even imaginary presence of the impartial spectator, the authority of the man within the breast, to overawe and moderate our feelings.
<cite>Theory of Moral Sentiments Part 7, Section 2</cite>
</div>
<p>Thus, Adam Smith&rsquo;s liberalism requires self-regulation which in turn requires the heart, which is then tuned to our highest personal ideals or those of our society.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="how-our-personal-moral-sense-as-our-conscience-regulates-the-ego-through-fellow-feeling-with-our-future-self">How our Personal Moral Sense as our Conscience Regulates the Ego through Fellow-feeling with our Future Self</h3>
<p>According to David Hume, <a href="/articles/social/david-hume-idea-of-self">each perception of our selves</a> is a discrete identity which is separate from our other selves. It means that the you of now is a different entity from the you 1 second from now and the you 2 minutes ago.</p>
<p>The conscience corrects our current self X by projecting the mind onto our future selves Y and Z which will bear the consequences of the actions of our self X. This then makes us correct our actions to avoid future pain.</p>
<p>For example, the conscience of a diabetic person will make him think twice about eating sweets because it knows that it will produce bad effects later. It projects its from from its current self onto its future self and feels the pain or weakness of that future self. This pain or weakness then corrects the action of the current self, as to avoid eating the sweets.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="how-our-social-moral-sense-as-our-sense-of-the-common-interest-regulates-our-actions-ego-in-society">How our Social Moral Sense as Our Sense of the Common Interest Regulates Our Actions Ego in Society</h3>
<p>This conscience turns into our sense of the common interst when expanded onto the social dimension. We don&rsquo;t punch others on the street because our minds project our selves onto the person that we intend to punch. We either foresee his pain or foresee his counter attack against us and feel our our pain then. This cognition of future pain makes us stop our action.</p>
<p>Our moral sense (the pain of future pain for ourselves or others) is usually overridden by the pleasures from own ego. For example, a corrupt politician knows that stealing is wrong. But the pleasure he gets from his ill-gotten wealth overrules the sense of the pain he is giving to others or the pain he is giving to his future self if caught.</p>
<p>A druglord knows that drugs are bad. But the pleasure from easy riches contradicts this bad feeling from his moral sense.</p>
<p>Hitler probably knew that invading other countries and killing innocents was bad. But the pleasure of seeing Germans dominate other people was far stronger than any pain from losing the war or sensing the suffering of foreigners and even his fellow Germans towards the end of the war.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="fellow-feeling-should-come-first">Fellow-Feeling Should Come First</h3>
<p>Before any action or policy is initiated, each person must have a fellow-feeling with his selves and with others. Without it, actions will likely be arbitrary and possibly hurtful to the self and others. Only when fellow-feeling and the moral sense is developed can self-regulatory policies be implemented.</p>
<!-- Taonomics will use machine learning on the Tao Network in order to provide supportive moral regulation.  -->
<!-- An example of a proper self-regulating economy is the family or tribal clan. They do not view money as wealth and therefore keep their internal trade subjective (according to feeling) instead of objective (according to numbers). No one ever saw a mother charge her children money for the dinner she cooks for them. Instead, the mother expects her children to do good in school and behave well in exchange. 

These are subjective measures based on ‘the impartial spectator’ and not objective ones based on the ego. In time, the tribal clan merged with other clans to become nations and naturally developed the division of labour which were called ‘castes’ in India and ‘hukou’ in China, allowing them to become great empires that were later studied by Smith.

 -->
<!-- Smith lived in a time when selfishness, utility, and profit maximization were not dominant ideas. Some people like Mandeville tried to advance them, but they were always successfully opposed by enlightened writers like David Hume. 

But somehow after the Enlightenment, the positive force that countered such shallow ideas grew weak, so that by the mid-19th century, you have no one countering Engels, Marx, and Nietzsche, nor Ayn Rand in the 1960's. So the word 'self-regulating' in enlightened 1779 is different from 'self-regulating' from 1850-2017 (the period when selfishness, marginal utility, and profit maximization became dominant ideas, as enshrined by the marginal revolution).
 -->
<!-- Most people interpret Smith using the current selfish and profit-maximizing mentality, not in the enlightened mentality of Smith's own time. David Hume says that although humans are selfish, human self-interest, when applied with the view of human society (which Smith called ‘fellow-feeling’) instead of the ego (self-love), actually leads to the subsequent foundation of promises (which is a good thing as it leads to trade and helps society prosper): -->
<!-- <div class="squote hume" data-sal="slide-right">
“But though this self-interested commerce of man begins to take place, and to predominate in society, it does not entirely abolish the more generous and noble intercourse of friendship and good offices. I may still do services to such persons as I love, and am more particularly acquainted with, without any prospect of advantage” 
<cite>Hume, Treatise of Human Nature</cite>
</div>

But the people who interpret Smith and Hume nowadays just take ‘self-interest’ and ‘self-love’ without applying ‘fellow-feeling’ nor the ‘impartial spectator,’ making it appear as if Smith and Hume were advocating selfishness and that a self-regulating market meant a profit-maximizing market, which are essentially contradictory and therefore absurd (since people regulate each other to maintain society, but people maximize profits to maintain only themselves). -->
