      <description>David Hume explained, in &amp;ldquo;National Characters&amp;rdquo;, that the natural environment of a society plays are role in its behavior. If a person were shaped by nature and nurture, then a society&amp;rsquo;s character is likewise shaped by its natural environment and the social cycles that nurture it.
Lord Bacon observed that the inhabitants of the warm south are generally more ingenious than those of the cold north. But where the native of a cold climate has genius, he rises to a higher pitch than can be reached by the southern wits.</description>

      <description>Many liberals advocate the self-regulation as an alternative to regulation by governments and institutions. They usually borrow passages from Adam Smith who said that the government should not lay its hand on the freedom of individuals to act as they see fit.

      <description>Feudalism is a way of controlling huge land areas where each land is divided into fiefs under a lord who is under a king, who is really the strongest lord. Thus, it can be viewed as a delegated way of governance. Forms of feudalism were practiced in Persia, India, and Turkey. The opposite of feudalism is the republican city-states of Greece and Rome.
Feudalism&amp;rsquo;s key characteristic is that the land stays with the nobility&amp;rsquo;s family forever and is not subdivided.</description>
