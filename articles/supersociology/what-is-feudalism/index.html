          <p>Feudalism is a way of controlling huge land areas where each land is divided into fiefs under a lord who is under a king, who is really the strongest lord. Thus, it can be viewed as a delegated way of governance. Forms of feudalism were practiced in Persia, India, and Turkey. The opposite of feudalism is the republican city-states of Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>Feudalism&rsquo;s key characteristic is that the land stays with the nobility&rsquo;s family forever and is not subdivided. Most people are therefore renters of the nobility&rsquo;s land, which means they have to pay something. This something can either be money, crops, or their lives through servitude, at a much higher cost that today&rsquo;s propety taxes.</p>
<p>This gave the nobility total control of what happens in the land. This can only happen after a chieftain or warlord conquers a state or some populated lands which is called the allodial (independent) system. Such a system usually takes root in:</p>
<ul>
<li>large countries like Russia, which kept its feudal system even in the 19th century</li>
<li>disorderly countries, like Europe in the Dark Ages, and the Warring States of China</li>
</ul>

<figcaption>The Golden Horde was among the biggest feudal systems in the world</figcaption> 
<p>Small countries like Greece and Rome were republics instead of being feudal kingdoms. In fact, Rome started as a city with a single king under Romulus and technically was not feudal. It then evolved into a republic and then an empire after Caesar. Imperial Rome did not become feudal because land and slaves were given to Roman citizens as a reward for military service. It would be similar to a feudal lord giving his own lands away to his peasant-militia every time they successfully invaded a rival kingdom.</p>
<p>Similarly, Athens started as a city under despotism, but switched quickly to democracy.</p>
<!--  and soldiers who kept their own slaves. Even the Roman slave-owners had rules on what they could do with their slaves. -->
<br>
<h3 id="how-did-feudalism-evolve-to-become-democratic-governments">How Did Feudalism Evolve to Become Democratic Governments?</h3>
<p>In time, the feudal lords get tired of fighting each other. The strongest lords became kings whom the lesser lords submitted to. The lords allowed the king to have a centralized government to dictate policies for the sake of getting relief from the stress of fighting.</p>
<p>Eventually, the king himself got tired of doing policymaking and micro-managing the feudal lords. He allowed the lords to form a parliament to debate the policies among themselves. They later evolved to become representatives who then checked the power of the King.</p>
<p>The common system in pre-modern times was the allodial system, where people settled anywhere and set their own territorial rules. For protection and justice, they would look to a village elder who was their chieftain. From there, they could choose to become:</p>
<ul>
<li>a democracy where people voted on everything, as in ancient Athens</li>
<li>a republic which had senate to vote on everything, as in ancient Rome</li>
<li>an empire or monarchy, which had an emperor or king to decide everything, as in China</li>
<li>feudalism, where mini-kings decided everything, as in Dark Ages Europe where no king is strong enough to be emperor</li>
<li>mercantile colony, where a single business corporation decided everything, as in India under the East India Company</li>
<li>theocracy, where everything is under clerics, as in Islamic caliphates</li>
</ul>
