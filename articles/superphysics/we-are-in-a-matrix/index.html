          <p>We know the existence of thing through our perceptions of it. Each perception has two aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>physical</li>
<li>metaphysical</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, when we see a mug, we have both the physical perception of a mug and a metaphysical idea of a mug nearly at the same time.</p>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/mugecon.jpg" width="400px">
<br>
<p>This means that the mug exists in two layers of reality:</p>
<ul>
<li>the physical mug exists in physical reality, which we see</li>
<li>the metaphysical mug exists in &lsquo;metaphysical reality&rsquo;, as our idea of what a mug is</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, we perceive something totally new. For example, when Covid first struck in early 2020, the doctors had <strong>no</strong> idea of it, even if they could see the physical disease. In this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>the physical disease exists</li>
<li>the metaphysical idea existed in Nature, but not in human minds. It only existed in the latter after the scientists established it as a new idea called Novel Coronavirus Disease, later renamed as Covid-19</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical things therefore are tangible and perceivable through our five senses, while metahysical things are perceivable through our intellect and feelings. The mug only existed after the maker of mugs had the idea of a mug, as to be able to create a physical mug. It follows that Covid-19 existed after Nature had the idea for it, and that its solution already exists in Nature*.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*This is why our proposed solution to end Covid is to end the war against the Amazon rainforest, just as the Spanish flu ended after the peace of World War I</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, every physical thing or perception has a corresponding metaphysical idea or feeling, and that the latter exists before the former does.</p>
<p>For example, before a novel is written, the idea for the novel must exist first. The changing flow of ideas and feelings of the author about the novel then lead to actual changes to the physical written novel.</p>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/type.jpg" width="400px">
<br>
<!-- a website must be coded first before it actually exists as a physical website, deployed by its developer. But before the web developer codes the website, he must first have the idea for it. The flow of his changing ideas and feelings about the website then influence the changes to the code which then changes the actual website.  -->
<p>We can then make an analogy that the Creator of the universe began writing Its ideas onto physical reality as the &lsquo;Big Bang&rsquo;. The changes in the universe then arose from Its changing ideas and feelings about it, just as the novel changes through time.</p>
<p>These ideas and feelings, thus, flow onto physical dimension in order to create reality in real-time. This is similar to how electricity flows to our TVs to give us objects on the screen, and how it flows as data on the internet as websites and web pages. These ideas are all made up of the positive and negative aspects, just as all data is made up of 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s and all novels have text and blank spaces.</p>
<!-- The Big Bang is therefore the universe booting up to create real things that are ultimately based on metaphysical ideas.  -->
<p>The Hindus call this Virtual Reality or Existence as <strong>Brahma</strong> and the Taoists call Its flow as the <strong>Tao</strong>. The ‘on’ or &lsquo;published&rsquo; state is called <strong>Saguna Brahma</strong> and the ‘off’ or &lsquo;draft&rsquo; state is called <strong>Nirguna Brahma</strong>.</p>
<p>All the data served by the internet pre-exists, so it means that all possibilities already pre-exist. If you have a problem, then it means its solution pre-exists and you just have to find it. If the solution does not pre-exist, then it means your problem is not really a problem.</p>
<p>For example, no one has ever imagined that humans should have three or four legs, and that having only two legs was a problem. Thus, there has never been a search for its solution.</p>
<p>On the contrary, people have imagined that our inability to fly was a problem and so the solution manifested itself as powered flight.</p>
