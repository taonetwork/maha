          <p>A lot of people confuse socialism, left wing, democracy, and communism with each other. This is because ideas from one generation are commonly usurped by later generations according to their different experiences, rather than creating new names for new ideas arising from those new experiences.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ni2rC5pbSjMiBLyOVEOIxQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>A modern day example is the mobile phone and smartphone. A mobile phone means mobile telephone. When computer-abilities were added to it, it became a ‘smartphone’. However, this name is wrong because the computer-ability outweighs the telephone-ability. People use their ‘smartphones’ more for watching movies, playing games, or text-chatting, instead of talking via voice as what a telephone would do. Nowadays, smartphones are more properly called mobile devices.</p>
<p>David Hume explained that such naming mistakes are caused by the mind always choosing the mental processes that expend the least energy — it tries to connect ideas and form new ones without thinking. Thus, the phone became smart and so it was called a smartphone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update Dec 2020: The recent term &lsquo;social distancing&rsquo; is another example of wrong naming. It&rsquo;s used to imply keeping a physical distance from each other in order to prevent virus transmission. However, society is abstract in essence. Therefore, social distancing would mean being aloof, or not thinking about others at all. Two busy employees might physically bump into each other and not even mind nor remember the incident. Such a case would really be social distancing in the proper sense. The correct term for avoiding the virus is &lsquo;physical distancing&rsquo;. The prevalence of &lsquo;social distancing&rsquo; (and the fact that no one is denouncing it in favor of &lsquo;physical distancing&rsquo;) is proof that the essential science of Metaphysics or Dialectics is dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3 id="political-misnaming">Political Misnaming</h3>
<p>In politics, this is commonly seen in the confusion between democracy and socialism.</p>
<p>Democracy first appeared in ancient Greece and was defined by Socrates* as a system where people could vote on everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Another problem is the word &lsquo;oligarchy&rsquo;. Socrates originally used it to mean rule through money. However, modern dictionaries wrongly define oligarchy as &lsquo;rule of the few&rsquo;. But tyranny, timocracy, and aristocracy are all ruled by a few people, and so the dictionary defintion is useless. What the dictionary staff probably did was simply to use the literal meaning of oligarchy as ὀλίγος or &lsquo;the few&rsquo;, not knowing that Socrates only used it to differentiate it from &lsquo;demos&rsquo; or &lsquo;the many&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Socialism</strong> first appeared in the 19th century from the French economists Henri de Saint-Simon as an alternative to the unregulated freedom after the French Revolution destroyed the power of the monarchy and the church:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freed peasants made up the first estate</li>
<li>The monarchs and the church made up the second estate</li>
<li>The merchants* and manufacturers made up the third estate</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>*After the French Revolution, the aristocrats were lumped into a term called &lsquo;capitalists&rsquo; because of the industrial revolution. Our <a href="/articles/pantrynomics/what-defines-capitalism">other post</a> explains why even the modern word &lsquo;capitalist&rsquo; is wrong because it originally meant profit-earners, which include farmers and peddlers. The classical term for modern capitalism is &ldquo;stock-jobbing&rdquo; which emphasizes the growth of paper stock price. Thus, Neo-classical Economics should be more accurately named as &lsquo;Paper Mercantilism&rsquo; and Capitalism as &lsquo;Stock-Paper Mercantilism&rsquo; as its subset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the peasants were split into two:</p>
<ul>
<li>The not-so-free socialized peasants who had private property</li>
<li>The free and unsocialized ones who also had private property</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem then began when Marx and Engels hijacked the socialism concept and diverted it into Communism &ndash; a class-less utopia where there is no freedom (rather, freedom is sacrificed in order to attain utopia). This led to the three branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extremely-not-free socialists as Communists <strong>who had no private property</strong></li>
<li>The not-so-free socialists who had private property</li>
<li>The free unsocialized peasants as anarchists who also had private property</li>
</ul>
<div class="squote" data-sal="slide-right">
D’autres auteurs, à la suite de Marx et Engels notamment, ont également qualifié Saint-Simon de socialiste. Le recours à la centralisation est la raison la plus souvent invoquée pour justifier le socialisme de Saint-Simon.<br><br>Si l’on définit le socialisme par trois critères (propriété collective des moyens de production ; absence de concurrence ; planification rationnelle des activités économiques), alors Saint-Simon n’est pas socialiste car il respecte, formellement, la propriété privée et les droits privés qui y sont associés : les profits. Pour lui, l’égalité industrielle [consiste] (…) en ce que chacun retire de la société des bénéfices exactement proportionnés à sa mise sociale, c’est-à-dire à sa capacité positive, à l’emploi utile qu’il fait de ses moyens, parmi lesquels il faut comprendre, bien entendu, ses capitaux
<cite> Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon, l'industrialisme et les banquiers, Franck Yonnet 2004</cite>
</div>
<!-- and Sismondi as a system which valued workers and peasants. This is opposite of James and John Stuart Mill who valued the capital* owners. -->
<!-- Note that even this is wrong and was only corrected in 1919 with the invention of the word technocrats). -->
<!-- ![](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/screens/oligarchy.png) -->
<p>This corruption of the word &lsquo;socialism&rsquo;, to mean not having private property, was continued by Lenin who was released by the Germans into Russia. This then established the corrupt version of socialism as the United Soviet Socialist Republic, which really should&rsquo;ve been the United Soviet Communist Republic.</p>
<p>The USSR should&rsquo;ve been the USCR.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fg8t-4HacALpwTF7Kq050w.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Because of Marx and Engels, socialism has since been defined to be the same as communism, very different from the socialism of the French Revolution.</p>
<br>
<p>But the Cold war is more recent than the French Revolution, so it would be naive to hope that everyone can go back to the original French definition</p>
<p>As a workaround, we&rsquo;ve created a new term called <a href="/social/social-networkism">social networkism</a> to bring back the original French idea (social) <!-- with the addition of the new concept of the soul of society (dialectical) --> which can manifest as a social network (networkism). It distances itself from anarchism or laissez-faire liberalism by espousing the unity of society over the unity of the self*.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Recall that, in our system, <a href="/medical/idea-of-self">a person has 3 billion selves</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When systematized as a government, it becomes a &lsquo;social network republic&rsquo; which we shorten to &lsquo;social republic&rsquo; so that countries will be named &lsquo;The Social Republic of Wakanda&rsquo; for example. This idea remains true to Socrates' Republic and the French Revolution which defined socialism to be in-between anarchism and monarchy, while clearly having private property.</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Social&rsquo; refers to the liberal or left-wing aspects or the democrat and oligarch that represents freedom</li>
<li>&lsquo;Republican&rsquo; refers to the conservative or right-wing aspects or the tyrants and aristocrats that represents control</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fr-ac4humLAx8ocsYXBVQA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Thus, a social republic unifies left and right wing into a single harmony* that alternates in leadership, while balancing personal freedom and state control.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Western universities shallowly interpret Socrates' musical advocacy as referring to audible music. In reality, his music refers to the symphony of feelings, whether of humans, animals, or the universe itself. This makes him consistent with the Asian philosophers who pushed for harmony with the Tao or dharma.</p>

<h3 id="the-ideology-matrix--social-cycles--spacetime">The Ideology Matrix = Social Cycles + Spacetime</h3>
<p>While this solves such a problem for this generation, future generations might hijack and usurp these repaired ideas and render them messed up as usual. To prevent this, we created an Ideology Matrix which classifies every socio-economic-political idea that can be possibly generated by the human mind.</p>
<p>It combines David Hume&rsquo;s work which explained the dynamics of the mind, with Socrates' cycles of democracy, tyranny, aristocracy, and oligarchy that matches the four castes of Eastern shudras, ksatriyas, brahmins, and vaeshyas. By doing so, we unify eastern and western metaphysics and show that both had the same core observations of human society and the human species, but using different terminologies.</p>

<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
The four governments are those of Crete and Sparta, which are generally applauded. Oligarchy comes next; this is not equally approved. It is a form of government which teems with evils. Democracy, which naturally follows oligarchy, although very different. Lastly comes tyranny, great and famous, which differs from them all and is the fourth and worst State. 
<cite>The Republic, Book 8</cite>
</div>
<br>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 3D matrix that classifies ideas based on three axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selfishness-nonselfishness (as a function of ego or the entity observing existence)</li>
<li>Objectivism-nonobjectivism (as a function of the natural duality of existence, or physics vs metaphysics, within space-time)</li>
<li>Social cycles (as a function of how the ego changes in duality in different space-times)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/ideologymatrix.jpeg" alt="Ideology Matrix"></p>
<br>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/matrix2.png" width="400px">
<br>
<p>By plotting their core ideas in our matrix, it is easier to see how different Socialism is from Communism.</p>
<p>The ideas then progress in a cyclical way from democracy to oligarchy, then back to democracy. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the expansionist ideas of the tyrannical Mongol Yuan dynasty was overturned by the Ming dynasty</li>
<li>the Ming started as aristocratic but turned oligarchic as it focused on trade and its Treasure fleet</li>
<li>the Ming Hong Wu emperor was later overturned by the isolationist policy of the more-democratic Qing dynasty</li>
<li>finally, it was overturned by Communist tyranny</li>
</ul>
<p>In America, this can be seen in:</p>
<ul>
<li>the oligarchy created by George W. Bush which was overturned by the democracy of Obama</li>
<li>the democracy of Obama was later overturned by the tyranny of Trump</li>
</ul>
<!-- From this, we can say that the tyrannical stage of America and China differs in their objective-ness, with China striving for standardization via their social credit system, while Trump goes for more arbitrariness. -->
<!-- ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*58okvB3XEPK5ClzXm4rKCQ.jpeg) -->
<p>The most sustainable political philosophies and economic systems are those that are near the center, which balance non-selfishness and objective-ness, while adapting to changes in the social cycles.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, this is called the Middle Way and is essential to sustainable happiness.</p>
<p>In economics, this would be Capitalist systems having a bit of Socialism (as what the Nordic countries are doing), or Socialist systems having a bit of Capitalism (as what China is doing, though they seem to take the state capitalism side too far).</p>
<!-- The ideology matrix is an essential part of Pantrynomics as it will help keep its implementation standardized near the center, yet be customizable in order to fit the current cycle of the country where it will be implemented, making it global yet local at the same time. It is implemented as one of the features of ISAIAH Match which is our machine learning platform.
