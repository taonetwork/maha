          <p>The Dialectics of Socrates, or David Hume&rsquo;s science of man, is a system of analysis based on the metaphysical nature or dharma or tao of anything that exists in reality, with the goal of solving real problems in order to keep up with that nature, dharma, or tao.</p>
<p>Socrates calls this dharma or tao as the first principle or true nature of anything.</p>
<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>Dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle. It is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure. By her gentle aid, she lifts up the eye of the soul which is literally buried in an outlandish slough. She uses as handmaids and helpers the sciences in the work of conversion. Custom calls them sciences. But they should have some other name implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science. We called this "understanding".</p>
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato Book 7, Chapter 4</cite>

<!-- <div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
The Pythagoreans who have enquired about harmony. They are wrong as the astronomers.
They investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard. But they never apply them to problems. They never reach the natural harmonies of number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not.. Their pursuit will be valuable for our objects if all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and connection with one another and become considered in their mutual affinities. Until then, there is no profit in pursuing them.
<cite>The Simple Republic by Plato Book 7, Chapter 4</cite>
</div> -->
<p>Current science is based on the physical perceptions of things that already exist. It then uses math to plot the patterns of these effectual perceptions. From those patterns, it tries to work back to the cause. The problem with this is that <strong>all causes are metaphysical in nature, but math is confined to physical perceptions</strong>. The best that math and science can do is to speculate on the causes based on the pattern of effects.</p>
<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
Surely the skilled mathematician is not a dialectician.
</div>
<br>
<p>Dialectics is an upgrade of current science as it not only find patterns in physical perceptions and facts, but also in metaphysical perceptions as the feelings, opinions, and interpretation of the facts by other minds*.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Recall that we <a href="/articles/superphysics/we-are-in-a-matrix">divided reality into physical and metaphysical realities</a>. Physical things exist in the former, while metaphysical things, such as ideas and feelings, exist in the latter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Science only deals with the interpetation of a dataset. But Dialectics deals with <strong>all possible interpetations</strong> of a dataset. By getting all the data, as well as all the interpretations of the data, then total knowledge is achieved.</p>
<p>But not all data is useful, just as not all interpretations are valid. To solve this, Dialectics uses wise minds to churn, project, then weed out the bad data and interpretations to preserve only the good and solid ones. Such minds have a more solid grasp of both metaphysics and physics or science and have no bias. Socrates does this churning process as the Socratic method wherein a wise mind takes an idea from a theorist and then walks forward with the theorist&rsquo;s mind towards the projected effect of his idea, or backwards in order to discover the cause together.</p>
<div class="squote socrates" data-sal="slide-right">
A person will find himself at the top of the intellectual world when he tries to discover the absolute by the light of reason only [via intution], without the help of the senses, and perseveres by pure intelligence until perceives the absolute good [dharma or tao]. This is the same as the sight that has seen the visible. This progress is called dialectic.
</div>
<br>
<p>Nowadays, this manifests as peer reviews where new theories and interpretations are filtered out by senior academics* who are supposed to have a better grasp of principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*In contrast to scientific peer reviews where the academic is a master of material principles, dialectical peer reviews are done by senior metaphysicians (dialecticians) who have a solid grasp of both Eastern and Western metaphysics. Unlike the academic who is verified by a man-made PhD, the seniority of a dialectician is verified by his ability to attain a natural samadhi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inferior theorists, such as Kant, would likely be filtered out by such minds, even by popular opinion. This explains why Kant attacked Dialectics:</p>
<div class="squote kant" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>Dialectics is a logic of illusion. It is a sophistical art for giving ignorance and intentional sophistries.. it teaches us nothing regarding the content of our cognitions. It merely shows the formal conditions of their accordance with the understanding, which do not relate to and are quite indifferent in respect of objects. Any attempt to employ it as a tool to extend our knowledge must end in mere nonsense since anyone can oppose any assertion.</p>
<cite>Part 2, Introduction, Simple Critique of Pure Reason</cite>
</div>
<br>
<p>The distillation of the total knowledge then leads to a single pattern knowledge from cause to effect which then are called principles or understanding. A product of the distillation of the knowledge* of Socrates, Spinoza, David Hume, Adam Smith, Johanes Kepler, with those of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism produces principles which we call <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Juan_Dalisay_Jr_The_Metaphysics_of_Things_Book_1?id=JY3tDwAAQBAJ">The Metaphysics of Things</a> or MoT.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Secondary sources include the writings of Pythagoras, Confucius, Quesnay, Montesquieu, Musashi, and PR Sarkar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MoT then becomes the foundation of Superphysics.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="the-german-corruption-of-dialectics">The German Corruption of Dialectics</h3>
<p>The Germans were good at math and so they corrupted dialectics into a system that deals with effects and not with the cause. Instead of focusing on the metaphysical aspects of dialectics, Hegel focused on the churning of data which he represented with historical events.</p>
<p>Engels and Marx then fully corrupted this idea by saying that the churning was caused by physical conditions as materialism. A better churn would result if the material conditions were mastered. The dialectical materialism of Marx resulted in evil, suffering, and death, which are the opposite of what the dialectics of Socrates aimed for.</p>
<p>Since then, the metaphysical and dharmic nature of Socratic dialetics have been forgotten. Dialectics nowadays refers to Hegel&rsquo;s dialectics that do not have any metaphysics nor even any mysticism*.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*The Republic clearly talks about reincarnation and chakras in the Story of Er</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/kantmarxcrop.jpg" alt=""></p>
<!-- 
 totally different from the corrupted German dialectics espoused by Hegel, Engels, and Marx. Socrates' dialectics is purely metaphysical and so the German "dialect materialism" is an inherent contradiction similar to "good evil". 
 -->
<p>Materialism, from both the German and British philosophers of the 19th century, extinguished the Enlightenment and led to World Wars, Communist Revolution, and the spread of profit maximization from Modern Economics which caused the 1929 crash and many financial crises.</p>
<p>These problems exist until today as terrorism, inequality, and global warming disasters, all because the same materialistic root from Hegel&rsquo;s time was never removed. Materialistic science will not be able to solve the problems created by materialism. Only Socratic dialetics, with its metaphysical base, can go out of the box and see the problem with new eyes.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="the-re-enlightenment">The Re-Enlightenment</h3>
<p>If the scientific revolution upgraded the natural philosopher into a scientist, then the dialectical revolution will upgrade the scientist into a superscientist (or dialectical scientist), with the upgrade representing a &lsquo;level-up&rsquo; in human understanding.</p>
<p>This upgrade manifests as the huge amounts of data and information absorbed and processed by the dialectician from all sources anywhere in the world in all of human history which the scientist neglects or refuses. For example, scientists refuse to regard myths and metaphysical works as information. They immediately refuse ideas from Ayurveda, Feng Shui, Reiki, souls, aliens, other dimensions, etc.</p>
<!-- / Dialectics is based on 
/ b universal principles 
/ | which we call 
/ i The Metaphysics of Things. 
/ You could think of modern science as a lower class of study, limited to the five senses (particularly vision), and Superphysics as a higher class of study that adds the senses of feeling and intuition. The objects are the same, but the paradigm is expanded and new tools are added. -->
<p>Dialectics is unbiased and so it can take this mass of ideas to be churned in order to extract common patterns that can lead to more solid principles. For example, it takes the observations on the levitation of Buddhist monks and the zipping of UFOs to add new possibilities of movement and propulsion to benefit space travel. These observations are then put into the black box of dialectical principles we called The Metaphysics of Things (MoT) in order to <a href="/solutions/material/how-to-fix-general-relativity/">create new ones</a>.</p>
<p>This system of collecting all possible data and then churning them with MoT in order to come up with solutions is then called <strong>Superphysics</strong>.</p>
<!-- This method takes the best principles from Western and Eastern philosophy to come up with universal ones as [The Metaphysics of Things or MoT](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JY3tDwAAQBAJ). MoT is the set of underlying principles that Superphysics works with, as an implementation of Socratic Dialectics. Eastern philosophy provides the overall truths and principles, while Western philosophy gives their specifics, creating philosophical teamwork to solve any problem that science cannot solve.  -->
<!-- Science cannot solve things absolutely because it relies on evidence, which is the effect. This is why it always lags and is behind the curve. 

Dialectics, on the other hand, is based on truths which is the cause, and can go ahead of the curve via predictions. A scientist only knows science, but a dialectician must know not only science AND metaphysics, but also the science and metaphysics of the West AND the East. 
 -->
<p>In the evolution of human understanding, Superphysics is the next and last stage after science.</p>
