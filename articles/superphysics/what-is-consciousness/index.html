          <p>In the previous post, we explained that there are only two things in Existence:</p>
<ul>
<li>experience</li>
<li>experiencer</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we said that a mind is a piece of the Experiencer where It does the experiencing.</p>
<p>Here we add that the Experiencer itself is called Consciousness which resides in the arena of the mind. Thus, consciousness and mind go together. An active mind always has consciousness, but a consciousness does not always have an active mind. Similarly, a live theater always has an audience, but an audience does not always have a theater.</p>
<!-- David Hume defined mind as an arena or theater where perceptions play out. Consciousness therefore is the perceiver of those perceptions.  -->
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/audience.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The combination of the consciousness and its mind then leads to the thinking or ideating action, just as a live theater creates a spectating action in the audience as whispers, cheers, boos, laughter, etc. This turns the mind from an arena into a processing unit of existence.</p>
<ul>
<li>The thinking is done by the mind, leading to thought</li>
<li>The experiencer (consciousness) then experiences the thought</li>
</ul>
<!-- This means that consciousness is the effect of existence and cannot possibly exist without the idea of existence. -->
<p>Does this mean that consciousness is the cause of existence? We experience the existence of a new day after we wake up and regain our consciousness. Therefore, consciousness causes existence, right?</p>
<p>This is not entirely correct because behind the waking up of consciousness is the desire to wake up. Thus, desire is the real cause of existence.</p>
<p>For example, if my consciousness wants to experience the existence of a pink elephant, then it will direct my mind to create one: from my memories of an elephant and the color pink.</p>
<p>In this case, the existence of the pink elephant in my mind needed four ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>A desire to experience a pink elephant</li>
<li>A memory of the color pink and an elephant</li>
<li>A mind where those are combined to create the metaphysical pink elephant</li>
<li>A consciousness to perceive it</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, existence is the effect and desire is the cause.</p>
<p>A lot of metaphysical doctrines and moral philosophies emphasize consciousness and mind, but do not look into the nature of desire and feelings.</p>
<p>Religions often talk about the Creator such as God or Allah, but do not explain Their motives for creating the universe. Thus, it is difficult for them to answer questions about the universe.</p>
<p>This is where Superphysics is different. It views feelings as waves and ideas as particles which support each other to create and maintain existence.</p>
<p>From here, it is easier to establish the maxim that &lsquo;mentality creates reality&rsquo;:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
It is an established maxim in metaphysics, that whatever the mind clearly conceives, includes the idea of possible existence, or in other words, nothing we imagine is absolutely impossible.
<cite>A Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1, Part 2, Section 2</cite>
</div>
<p>A variation of this is &lsquo;If you want to experience a certain reality, then you first have to want it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some people go through life without knowing what they want. Whereas, others claim that they know exactly what they want. Both are extremes which will reduce the probability of them experiencing their desired reality &ndash; the former has too little power to particalize their waves, while the latter has too much desire leading to a premature and rigid particalizaiton*.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*This will be explained in future posts</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- > *Having too little desire makes the waves very weak. Having too much desire  -->
<!-- This however, would be purely philosophical and impractical  have nothing to do with our social cycles  because . It would also be impractical because we cannot create things instantaneously by merely thinking of them (rather, it could take a lot of time before they physically exist). -->
<!-- But wait! Wouldnâ€™t having two opposing definitions for the same thing be absurd (i.e. paradoxical) since one definition would instantly destroy the other? Yes. To remove the paradox, we take our 'existence-creates-consciousness' idea first and then flip that into 'consciousness-creates-existence' idea afterwards. 

This flip is the same as a rescuer securing himself before securing others. The first step is very small and insignificant relative to the second step. 

![](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/childmask.jpg) -->
<h2 id="consciousness-is-the-experiencer-of-existence">Consciousness is the Experiencer of Existence</h2>
<p>Thus, we regard consciousness as the Experiencer which has only one task: to experience existence.</p>
<p>In addition, consciousness is only binary. It is only on or off. Either consciousness experiences or does not and is unconscious. When a person says that society&rsquo;s consciousness isn&rsquo;t evolved yet, it really means that society&rsquo;s mind* is not evolved yet, or has not enlarged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Remember that a mind is like a theater which has a size and many other features, whereas consciousness has only one feature which is to be either on or off, experiencing or not-experiencing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its additional tasks of logic and thinking arises when <strong>desire</strong> is added onto it. This desire brings consciousness onto different physical or metaphysical experiences in a sequential manner, all of which are stored in its mind. This sequence leads to the concept of logic, while the storage leads to memory.</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>desire is the ultimate cause and is the source of all mystery</strong>. Why do you desire what you desire? What desire led to the criminal to do the crime? Why did the dinosaurs desire to fly and evolve into birds? Why did the universe desire to have four (or five) fundamental forces instead of three? What desire led the British to drive on the left and not on the right side of the road?</p>
<p>It is this solving of desire that solves mysteries by revealing the true nature, tao, or dharma of the desiring entity.</p>
