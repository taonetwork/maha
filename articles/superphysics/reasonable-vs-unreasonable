consciousness on or off 
ego feeling of self wanting to exist in the Matrix
mind as the arena where the consciousness experiences ideas and where the ego senses feelings
dharma is being in line with the true nature or how it was designed by the creator
adharma is being not in line with one's true nature
positive feelings, such as happiness, contentment, love, peace are the result of being within une's true nature
negative feelings, such as sadness, greed, hatred, and stress are the result of being within une's true nature
immorality are the qualities of actions that will lead to negative feelings
morality are the qualities of actions that will lead to positive feelings

When someone says 'be reasonable' it really means:

- Please have a desire to project your consicousness onto a mental thought-experiment of the future where the bad consequences of your current improper actions will lead to the suffering of either yourself or others, or both, and then feel that suffering and then decide if that future suffering is worth whatever you imagine to gain from your current improper action. 

This requires:
- the desire of the person to feel about consequences or to even think about it
- the mental ability and energy to project his mind onto those consequences 
- the emtional ability to feel the suffering as bad enough to stop the immoral action

For example, a divorce would be immoral under most circumstances as it would deprive the child of love and support. But if the spouse is suffering too much as to die, such as being beaten, then it would be more moral to have a divorce. In this case, the chronic, constant suffering is worse than the future suffering of the child. 

However, if a divorce was thought of just because the spouse fell in love with another person, then it might be immoral to have a divorce because the interests of the children outweigh the romance of the spouse.
