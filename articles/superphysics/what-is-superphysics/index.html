          <p>From the time of Descartes to Kant, philosophy dominated the study of human knowledge in the West. It included metaphysics and was only countered by religion.</p>
<p>Science was then called Natural Philosophy which dealt with natural physical phenomena in line with metaphysical principles. For example, Newton&rsquo;s Principia cited God as the source of nature&rsquo;s movements.</p>
<p>But by the 19th century, the Europeans separated Natural Philosophy from Philosophy. It mutated into materialist science which was totally separate from metaphysics. The problem with this is that metaphysics is rooted in the feelings and not from the five senses. By denying metaphysics or God, then the feelings are ejected, and the ego (the feeling of the self) is the only feeling that remains.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="intellect-trapped-in-an-echo-chamber">Intellect Trapped in an Echo Chamber</h3>
<p>In addition, science caused natural philosophy to be compartmentalized. Intellectuals were confined to specific domains such as Physics, Biology,  Economics, etc. People could no longer have multiple domain knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, Isaac Newton had expertise not only in Math and Physics, but also in Finance and Theology. Adam Smith was a historian, moral philosopher, economist, and linguist. Francois Quesnay of the Physiocrats was a medical doctor and an economist and mathematician. This allowed such pre-science people to find priniples common to various domains and establish them as maxims.</p>
<p>In contrast, modern researchers and academics are confined to their own bubbles. Can we imagine Paul Samuelson being a mathematician-economist and a medical doctor at the same time? Can we think of John Maynard Keynes as a financial economist, entrepreneur, and a priest rolled into one?</p>
<p>Science thus became degraded from being 6-sense Natural Philosophy into 5-sense Materialist or egotistic Science, with their own intellectual fiefs. In other words, Science has only &lsquo;me&rsquo; as my ego and my five senses in my own mental bubble. Anything beyond my five senses and domain is fake and pseudoscience.</p>
<p>The problem is that the Asian sciences, such as Ayurveda and Yoga, are based on all 6-senses and are not as compartmentalized. These accept the non-obvious inferences from the feelings of the soul and spirit and apply them onto different domains.</p>
<p>For example, Taoism naturally leads to traditional chinese medicine, just as Hinduism leads to ayurveda for medical problems, yoga for psychological ones, and the caste system* for social order.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*The caste system was initally a system of division of labor to handle the economic growth and development of ancient India. Like any long-running system, it slowly degraded into rigidity and oppression</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way, science resembles a religion that treats other beliefs as false religions. This then limits science to inferior inside-the-box solutions just as religion was limited in solving anything.</p>
<p>To create better solutions to the new problems created by global warming, overpopulation, viruses, etc., we bring back metaphysics and natural philosophy as the 6-sense study of dialectics that is not confined into specific domains*.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Its divisions of Material, Medical, and Social Superphysics are not rigid boundaries, but rather general groupings for convenience, like chapters in a book. Dialectics is like the art of cooking, while Superphysics is the resulting dish &ndash; one implies the other and, like cause and effect, can never be separated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brings alternative solutions to the table.</p>

<p>The weakness of science in not knowing how the flow of feelings work is evident in:</p>
<ul>
<li>the proposals of scientists to limit global warming not being adopted by countries that only feel for their own national interests</li>
<li>the proposals of scientists to stop oil exploration not being adopted by businessmen who only want profit for themselves</li>
<li>people not obeying scientific mask-mandates due to their own ego</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 id="data-science-as-the-main-tool-of-socratic-dialectics-and-humes-science-of-man">Data Science as the Main Tool of Socratic Dialectics and Hume&rsquo;s Science of Man</h3>
<p>Since science has been around since the 19th century, it would be naive to think that it will upgrade itself to include human feelings immediately. That&rsquo;s why we suggest a transitional science called Superphysics to represent 6-sense Dialectics of Socrates or David Hume&rsquo;s Science of Man, until science lowers its ego and add feelings back onto itself.</p>
<!-- Unlike Science that requires 100% replicability, Superphysics only needs 51+% replicability since every mind and wave-pattern is different.  -->
<p>Because it relies on all six senses, Socrates calls Dialectics more laborious than the sciences. This explains why it was rarely developed.</p>
<p>An alternative cancer cure that works for Mr. X might not work for Mr. Y, making it unacceptable to &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; modern medicine which throws away such useful cures. Superphysics solves this by finding out the pattern of differences between Mr. X and Y so that that the cure can work for all Mr. X-types. It then finds the cures that fit Y-types, Z-types, etc. This method is unthinkable in science because the ego wants to think of itself as unique and does not want itself to be classified or branded</p>
<p>A common example is how the Japanese believe that human behavior can be categorized according to four blood types, which was pseudo-science <a href="https://www.tmc.edu/news/2020/06/blood-type-may-affect-covid-19-outcomes-study-shows/">until Covid came</a>.</p>
<!-- The goal is to solve problems by going outside of the box imposed by science. Superphysics adds that quality control to determine which is good pseudo-science and which is quack pseudo-science or those with zero or random replicability, in order to fill in the gaps in human knowledge and finally solve those unsolved by science. 
 -->
<p>Data Science* is really good at classification and in finding patterns and so it will be the primary tools of the Superphysicist, Superphysician, and Supersociologist who are upgraded from ordinary physicists, physicians, and sociologists/economists. The discovery of patterns in scientific data makes Superphysics a bridge between physics and metaphysics, or science and philosophy.</p>
<div class="squote hume" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>All the sciences have a relation to human nature. No matter how far any science runs away from human nature, it still returns by one way or another. In pretending to explain the principles of human nature, we in effect propose a complete system of the sciences. This system is built on an almost entirely new foundation. This foundation is the only one on which the sciences can be secured. The science of man is the only solid foundation for the other sciences.</p>
<cite>Hume, Simple Treatise, Advertisement</cite>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>*Data Science is more of an art than a science. It cooks up useful predictions and interpretations of raw data using statistical techniques and activation functions, just as a chef cooks up dishes from raw ingredients using steaming, frying, marinating, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/spflow.png" alt="Superphysics relationships"></p>
<p>Superphysics is then split up into three, based on a perception&rsquo;s relation to the self:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="/material">Material Superphysics</a> — aims to solve problems that physics cannot, such as faster-than-light travel, time travel, alternative energy sources. This is derived from Book 1 of A Treatise of Human Nature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/medical">Medical Superphysics</a> — aims to solve problems that medical* science cannot, such as cancer, heart disease, mental issues, etc. This is derived from Book 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/social">Social Superphysics</a> — aims to solve problems that economics and political science cannot, such as recessions, inequality, revolutions, etc. This is derived from Book 3</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Supersociology is the subset that deals with socio-political principles</li>
<li>Pantrynomics deals with economic principles</li>
</ul>
<!-- <br>
<br>
  
### What is the difference between Modern Physics and Material Superphysics?

Modern physics is limited to the physical world which are sensed by humans through their five senses. An example of a limitation created by modern physics is rocket technology which is expensive and full or problems, keeping humans stuck on one planet when there are billions of planets to explore.

The propulsion systems of NASA and SpaceX are ultimately based on a caveman technology called combustion, under the paradigm of Newtonian Physics. They spend a lot of effort and money in improving a backward technology, which naturally leads to very little results.

![](/graphics/caveman.jpg)

To solve this, we add proper metaphysics, defined by David Hume and already known in the Vedas and Bhagavad Gita in the East, to breach the limitation of modern Physics by tapping in directly to the nature or universals of space-time.

![](/graphics/grav.jpg)

The Eastern concept of Sunya, or Hume’s concept of vacuum, is the foundation of the faster-then-light travel and anti-gravitation of Superphysics. Without it, such teleportation technology would be unthinkable.

The understanding of this metaphysics will be more easily understood in its first implementation as Pantrynomics, which is under Social Superphysics. Unlike Material Superphysics which requires specialized equipment and unlike Medical Superphysics which is highly regulated, Social Superphysics is mostly behavioural and historical. This makes it cheaper to research and implement solutions for.

For example, one of the end goals of Pantrynomics is economic singularity wherein an ego-less artificial intelligence maps the economy to coordinate supply and demand to ensure that everyone has adequate resources to exist and reach their life goals. This is similar to the end goal of Material Superphysics which is a space-time singularity map wherein an artificial intelligence knows all space-time coordinates in advance so that it can coordinate spaceships traveling into each location.
