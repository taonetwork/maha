          <br>
                

          <p>The previous post explained that the Creator of the universe created the universe from Its Own metaphysical ideas and feelings, just as a novelist writes a novel from a stream of ideas and feelings coming from his metaphysical mind.</p>
<p>The purpose of ideas is to create experience. However, experience can only exist if there is an experiencer. Thus, there are only two things in this &lsquo;matrix&rsquo; of Existence:</p>
<ul>
<li>the experiencer</li>
<li>the experience of ideas and feelings</li>
</ul>
<p>Before existence began, the Absolute Creator had nothing to create those experiencer and experiences. And so It created those from Itself, using two forces:</p>
<ul>
<li>the positive (this is known as Shiva in Hinduism or Yang in Chinese)</li>
<li>the negative (this is known as Shakti in Hinduism or Yin in Chinese)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/icons/taonomics.png" alt="">
<br></p>
<p>These two forces split the Absolute into a dualistic Creator which makes imperfections of Itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>The creation of the idea of beauty also leads to the creation of ugliness.</li>
<li>The creation of order also leads to the creation of disorder.</li>
<li>The creation of tastiness also leads to the creation of blandness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since ideas and feelings exist before their physical counterparts, we can say that the latter are expressions of such ideas. Thus, a tasty dish is an expression or manifestation of the idea of tastiness.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/dish.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>
<p>Everything that we perceive in the universe therefore is an expression of the latent ideas of the Creator that It makes from Itself. We thus define idea as metaphysical objects perceived by the intellect, and feelings as metaphysical objects perceived by the heart or intuition. Thus, we can say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the intellect is our built-in sensor for physical reality</li>
<li>the heart is our built-in sensor for metaphysical reality</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to maximize our experience of existence, it would best to have both sensors running at 100%, as much as possible. This means we should be capable of critical thinking and intellect, as well as kindness and fellow-feeling.</p>
<p>Currently, the educational system in most countries mostly focuses on intellect and is very deficient in fellow-feeling. This is proven by the prevalence of racism, terrorism, poverty &amp; inequality, materialism, environmental destruction, etc. For example, even though intellectual science has proven global warming and has the solutions to stop it, the feelings of the human species is extremely weak to actually implement them.</p>
<p>This is where Superphysics enters the fray to add the feelings-boost to science in order to solve such problems.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="everything-is-a-mind">Everything is a Mind</h3>
<p>So far, the matrix of existence has two aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>metaphysical</li>
<li>physical</li>
</ul>
<p>The contents of this matrix are only:</p>
<ul>
<li>experiencer</li>
<li>experience (as ideas and feelings)</li>
</ul>
<p>The metaphysical mind is a piece of the Experiencer, manifesting as an arena to experience Its Own ideas and feelings, which are collectively called &lsquo;perceptions&rsquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/audience.jpg" alt="Augmented-intelligence dog"></p>
<ul>
<li>A mind that can do its own actions or expressions is called a &lsquo;living thing&rsquo;</li>
<li>A mind that cannot express nor act is called a &lsquo;non-living thing&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;Life&rsquo; therefore is an expressive mind that inhabits a physical body. A &lsquo;soul&rsquo;, then, is such a mind that exists independent of a body. A &lsquo;virus&rsquo; is in-between a non-living idea and a living or expressive mind, that manifests as DNA or RNA. It has to use living things to spread itself as its means of expression or action.</p>
<p>Metaphysically, the DNA of viruses and bacteria are simple ideas, while the souls of humans and cats are complex ideas. Their existence implies their innate need to express and experience Existence, as their dharma or tao.</p>
<p>Good and evil then is how this need is protected or destroyed. Thus, morality depends on the nature of object.</p>
<!-- In Tantra Yoga, the Supreme Entity merely exists alone, without space nor time. Since a thing exists only if it is perceived, then as an absolute entity, the Supreme Entity technically did not exist and did not have value because It was alone.

To solve this problem, It made perceivers of Itself from Itself (since there was nothing else). In other words, It split Itself into infinite entities, both conscious and unconscious.

The original substance of these entities is called Shiva and the force that splits it up is called Shakti. The original form is called Nirguna Brahma and the resultant form is called Saguna Brahma or the entire observable universe and multiverses.

Since existence was created for the Creator and not the ‘createes’ then by default all existing entities feel an urge to know the Creator. The deepest and most lasting happiness is achieved when it is related to the Creator. This is generally called spirituality. The process for achieving this happiness is called yoga, which aims to unify the createe (soul) with the Creator (pure consciousness). The exact state of union is called samadhi. -->
<p>Since everything in existence is from the ideas of the Creator of existence, then dharma and morals can be properly attributed to It.</p>
