          <p>People&rsquo;s confusion regarding Smith&rsquo;s works, such as his stand on capitalism, arises because he did not define nor explain self-interest, private ownership, and why a person should have the profits of one&rsquo;s own work.</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
It is but equity that those who feed, clothe and lodge the the people, should have such a share* of the produce of their own labour
</div>
<!-- is to give outside owners the right to the work of others (as if feeding from them), which violates the concept of economic justice, which Smith never explained fully. He just said the following without explaining why: -->
<p>Capitalism violates the concept of profit-sharing by giving all the profits* to the investor or owner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Currently, the poor clearly do not get a share of the proceeds of their labor, since wages are measured in nominal terms, such as $10/hour. In Smith&rsquo;s system, wages would be measured in real value, such as 2.5 big Macs/hour, equating wages with food. This system was later objected to by Malthus who said that it would worsen famines, neglecting the fact that Smith said such a system will only be enforced during normalcy and not during disasters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this is not obvious to modern economists because Smith did not define these explicitly. Instead it was mixed up in his long explanations which made it hard to understand to shallow-minded readers. Worse, he simply referred the reader to other writers who explained those concepts in even more detail:</p>
<!-- The establishment of a government gave security to industry that it shall enjoy the fruits of its own labour; It is the only encouragement industry requires -->
<!-- Smith did not bother to explain these in detail because they have been already explained by other authors and it would be better to simply point the reader to them: -->
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
This scheme is explained fully by Mr. du Verney in his Examination of the Political Reflections upon Commerce and Finances of Mr. du Tot that I shall not give any account of them.
</div>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
Mun’s book,England’s Treasure in Foreign Trade, became a fundamental maxim in the political economy of England and all commercial countries.
<cite>On the Maxims of Mercantile System</cite>
</div>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
David Hume has answered most deeply, clearly, and elegantly as to why utility pleases.
<cite>On Utility, from Simple TMS Book 4, Chapter 1</cite>
</div>
<p>In other words, Smith is like saying, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t explain their works, you must read them yourself! Don&rsquo;t be lazy.&rdquo; Smith gives one clear instance of academic laziness causing mistakes in prices, which in turn contributed to the wrong economic policies being implemented:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
They were misled by the careless transcription of ancient statutes by lazy copiers and by the legislature.
<cite>Simple WN, Book 1, Chapter 11</cite>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="the-influence-of-hume">The Influence of Hume</h3>
<p>In both <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> and <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em>, David Hume stands out as the one consistently admired by Smith, aside from Quesnay and Hutcheson. If you read Books 2 and 3 of Hume&rsquo;s <em>Treatise of Human Nature</em>, you will see the origin of Smith&rsquo;s ideas on sentiments, sympathy, justice, and even division of labour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other authors, such as Cannan, wrongly attributes Smith&rsquo;s division of labour to Mandeville. This error is proven by the fact that Smith said that Mandeville&rsquo;s philosophy was wrong and opposite of the one he was advancing<!-- (Licentious Systems) -->. For example, the purpose of Mandeville&rsquo;s divison of labour is utility for the self, whereas Hume&rsquo;s is for existence and society.  Cannan probably saw the same words &lsquo;division of labour&rsquo; from both Smith and Mandeville and made the connection without going into their subtle differences. <!-- This common human infirmity to readily connect things was fully explained by Hume. It --> This mistake can also be seen more recently in Samuelson&rsquo;s wrong interpretation of Smith&rsquo;s invisible hand. He probably just saw the words &lsquo;self-interest&rsquo; and made his own connection to &lsquo;selfish-interest&rsquo;.
To Socrates, this is a technique used by sophists who <!-- capitalize on this infirmity by using --> connect seemingly similar words in order to craft absurd philosophies which might make sense on the surface, but actually have zero foundation. Examples of such sophistical philosophies are Objectivism and laissez faire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is so much similarity between Smith and Hume, that I would go as far to say that The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations have their base in Hume. <strong>This implies that an expert on Smith&rsquo;s works must know something about Hume&rsquo;s major works.</strong> Hume praised Plato&rsquo;s works and so we can add Socrates, Plato&rsquo;s guru, to the influences of Hume and Smith.</p>

<p>It is so easy to see that these ideas have been overturned by economists and free-marketers who say that excess is good for society, profits must keep on increasing, and government must never restrain private interests. Such shallow and popular ideas crop up all the time and should be expected. But there should always be wiser humans to counter them so that they won&rsquo;t take root in the minds of the majority. For example, Hume countered the prevalent dogmatic Christian beliefs, while Smith countered mercantile beliefs and self-interested philosophies.</p>
<p>Why is our generation lacking the same wise people to counter ultra-rational beliefs* such as Utilitarianism, Liberalism, and Objectivism? If the experts on Smith and Hume successfully countered laissez faire from the 1990&rsquo;s, would the 2008 Financial Crisis happen? Must it take another huge economic crisis for wiser philosophers to come up and counter ultra-rationalism, just as a meat lover must suffer from a stroke before listening to a doctor who comes up and advises him to cut down on meat?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Smith and Hume point to the heart or feeling as the basis or morality and not the brain or intellect, whereas rationalists focus solely on the brain or intellect, disregarding feeling. By disregarding feelings, rationalism allows only one feeling to exist &ndash; the feeling of the self or ego, as without ego one does not exist.  Thus, by denying feeling, rationalists unknowingly breed selfishness and end up working against society and themselves in the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rationalism and objectivism are useful in backward societies that have no reason, such as in ultra-religious countries that oppress their own people. But they are usually harmful in modern societies that are already too intellectual or rational. Modern societies need more heart instead. Thus, an ideal human philosophy should balance heart and brain, with the heart first and brain immediately afterwards, as what is observed naturally.</p>
