          <p>Pantrynomics will use Purchasing Power as its alternative to GDP, as explained in The Digression on the Value of Silver of the Wealth of Nations.</p>
<p>In that Digression, Adam Smith proved that money supply, as the prices of gold and silver, are not correlated with a society&rsquo;s wealth or poverty. Instead, he wanted to prove that it is the money price of some rude produce relative to the main food grain (such as wheat), which is the clearest indicator of a society&rsquo;s wealth or poverty.</p>
<p>To do this, he had to write about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the price of wheat (rude produce) in three periods</li>
<li>the price of silver in the world and its ratio to gold</li>
<li>the nature of the price of rude produce</li>
</ul>
<!-- - Periods
  - First Period
  - Second Period
  - Third Period
    - Growth of Silver Demand
      - Market of Europe
      - Market of America
      - Market of Asia
    - Variations In Values Of Gold And Silver
      - Grounds Of The Suspicion That The Value Of Silver Still Continues To Decrease
    Effects Of The Progress Of Improvement on Three Sorts Of Rude Produce

        Second Sort
        Third Sort
    Conclusion of Digression
  -->
<p>In the same way, we want to objectively prove that GDP (measured in dollars instead of silver) is not a proof of the wealth of a country. Instead, it is the collective grain value, as purchasing power, that a society needs in order to gain possession of all the cars, iPhones, bus tickets, real estate, etc. in that society for a certain timespan.</p>
<p>The individual and aggregate purchasing power of a city or country is then compared to itself in the past or with other cities or countries. In this way, we can more easily say whether the US, China, or the EU is really wealthier and which country&rsquo;s wealth is based more on real value, instead of fake or nominal value. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to live in a country that has more real value and is more resistant to economic crises?</p>
<!-- So, we follow Smith's methodology in getting the grain values of key rude produce to  -->
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>Finding an easy proof of a country's prosperity may be useful to the public.</p>
<cite>Wealth of Nations Book 1, Chapter 11, Digression</cite>
</div>
<p>Basically, <strong>the aggregate purchasing power of a society or Net Domestic Product (NDP) is its GDP minus the revenue of its entire financial system</strong> which we notate as:</p>
<div class="squote tao" data-sal="slide-right">
<h3 style="color: white">NDP = GDP - $</h3>
<ul><li>NDP: Net Domestic Product</li><li>GDP: Gross Domestic Product</li><li>$: Gross Revenue of the entire financial system and insurance of a country</li>
</div>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>The money which circulates the society's whole revenue among its members makes no part of that revenue. The great wheel of circulation is different from the goods which are circulated through it. The society's revenue is in those goods, not in the wheel that circulates them.<br></br> In computing any society's gross or net revenue,we must always deduct the whole value of money from the whole annual circulation of money and goods. The value of money can never make a part of the society's gross or net revenue.</p>
<cite>Wealth of Nations Book 2</cite>
</div>
<p>Money and finance are just tools to circulate real value as services (haircuts, cleaning, construction, utilities) and products (iPhones, potatoes, clothes). They are not real value or wealth themselves.</p>
<p>For example, a family has no internal financial system that charges the children a fee each time their mother cooks a meal for them. Instead, they pay back by getting good grades and doing as they&rsquo;re told. Family life would actually be more difficult and unnatural if the parents imposed such an internal financial system.</p>
<p>There are two ways to get the NDP, just as there are two ways to get the GDP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top-Down</li>
<li>Bottom-Up</li>
</ul>
<!-- Purchasing Power (Supply Side Productivity) -->
<!-- Ratio of commodities to grain or Grain index (Demand Side Consumption) -->
<br>
<h3 id="top-down">Top-Down</h3>
<!-- Purchasing power is the net revenue from GDP or gross revenue of a society. It is made up of the net profits that go to the wallets or vaults of business owners, and wages that goes to the wallets or bags of employees. Unlike the GDP of Economics which is only measured in currency, the purchasing power of Pantrynomics is measured in both money and non-money as grains. -->
<p>This approach deducts the effort of society in maintaing the money-system that circulates the real value between people. Currently, this effort manifests as the banking, financial, and insurance systems. In the past, it was the imperial system of the Romans and ancient Chinese made up of a rent-seeking class* of tax collectors and eunuchs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Pantrynomic systems aim to reduce corruption by reducing the rent-seeking and profit-seeking classes through automation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expenses for finance charges, insurance premiums, interest payments, credit card annual fees, etc. all go as into the gross revenue of banks, fintech, and financial institutions.  These are therefore deducted from the GDP to arrive at the NDP.</p>
<p>For example, the GDP or gross revenue of Singapore is nominally $323.9b. Its purchasing power would be the GDP minus the entire gross revenue of its financial and insurance system for that year. This includes its social security and pension system.</p>
<!-- tax payments to government and the cost of money used up in producing that GDP . This cost of money is the expense in using the money and financial system for circulating the real value in any economy. -->
<!-- In order to buy bread, I have to work for money and then use the money to buy bread. If my work could be bartered directly for bread, then money would not be needed and all the spending for bankers, financiers, ATMs, bank branches, dollar bills, coins, etc could be freed up and made to do other things useful for society. This multi-exchange ability of Pantrynomics lets it work with money or run moneyless, something that Economics cannot do.   -->
<br>
<div class="box">
<h3>Why do we need to deduct the entire financial revenue?</h3>
<p>(Update Jul 2021)</p>
<p>Currently, GDP includes the revenue from financial activities, which Smith classifies as unproductive labor and can never be the solid foundation of any economy*.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Singapore, Hongkong, and Switzerland can base their economy on financial services because they are tiny countries serving global customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A recent proof* is Lebanon&rsquo;s GDP which was artificially propped up by state-run financial ponzi scheme. When that scheme collapsed, their GDP crashed suddenly, leading to instant unrest, violence, and death. A larger example is the 2008 Financial Crisis that was left unchecked, as to lead to the Great Recession and secular stagnation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*An older example is the Mississippi Scheme by John Law in France.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An NDP system would expose the lack of real value in an economy immedately so that policymakers or the people can take appropriate measures, instead of being fooled into complacency.</p>
</div>
<!-- If purchasing power is the value that went into your wallet, then GDP is the gross sales that you made from which you got that purchasing power. GDP can be seen as economic sales volume -- a seller can have brisk sales but have very low margins. He could even be selling at a loss and cannibalize his own savings! An example is Brazil and Trump's America which did not lock down in 2020. Their GDP was gained at the cost of a reduction of their own population.
 -->
<br>
<h3 id="bottom-up">Bottom-Up</h3>
<p>Governments will likely stick to the GDP system instead of computing the revenue of its financial system. So we can build the NDP from the bottom-up by computing the actual purhases of people relative to the past and those of other countries.</p>
<p>For example, the value of the purchases of a sample of five random people for this month can be compared to their purchases last month and last year. To eliminate the financial aspect, we peg the value to grains, through a grain index, instead of money.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<!-- 3. Bottom up by estimating the changes in the purchases of a sample population or sector. This will be done through a suvrvey of what people bought this month compared to last month and will likely be used by the societies that cannot automate. For example:

- Individual PP= Quantity and Quality of Goods and Services that can be bought by a person, pegged in either gold or grain
- National PP= Summation of Individual PP
- National PP per capita= National PP divided by population
 -->
<!-- The Grain index, as stated in the Digression is theratio of the price of commodities to the price of grain.  For example: -->
<ul>
<li>If a kilo of rice in the Philippines $0.75 and a kilo of chicken is $2.50 then 1 rice : 0.33 chicken.</li>
<li>If a kilo of rice in Vietnam is $0.50 and chicken is $5, then 1 rice : 0.10 chicken.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that chicken is really cheaper in the Philippines, meaning that while Vietnamese enjoy cheaper rice, Filipinos enjoy luxuries better (to Smith, meat is a luxury).</p>
<p>This is consistent if we replace chickens with cars. A Toyota Vios is 16,000 kg rice in the Philippines, but 44,250 kg rice in Vietnam.</p>
<p>This would then guide people on which cities or countries they might want to move to, in order to match their social status, fulfilling the requirement of Adam Smith that our model must have a practical use. The rich could use this to justify moving to Singapore, while the lower classes might use it to decide to live in the Philippines or Vietnam.</p>

<p>The amount of the metal pieces which circulate in any country must always be of much less value than the worth of that money. But the power of purchasing or the goods which can be bought with that money, must always be the same value with that money. The revenue of those who receive that money must be of the same value with the money they receive. That revenue consists in thepower of purchasing or the goods which can be bought. It cannot consist in those metal pieces of which the amount is so much inferior to its value.</p> 
<cite>Simple Wealth of Nations, Book 2</cite>
</div>
<p>This system can of course be used for policymaking. Both Economics and pantrynomics will conclude that Singapore is the most prosperous country and Vietnam the least prosperous of the three, from the supply side. But from the demand side, pantrynomics can reveal much more info:</p>
<ul>
<li>The poor of Vietnam are &lsquo;wealthier&rsquo; than the poor of the Philippines (which is really the poorest)</li>
<li>The middle class of Vietnam is the poorest of the three</li>
<li>The rich of the Philippines are more prosperous than that of Singapore</li>
<li>Because the poor benefit in Vietnam, the policies are likely pro-poor and anti-rich, consistent with Communism</li>
<li>Because the rich benefit in the Philippines, the policies are likely pro-rich and anti-poor, consistent with oligarchy</li>
</ul>
<p>So by combining GDP, Grain index, NDP and personal NDP, we can get a more granular picture of the real economic situation of a society. By plotting the ratios of prices of different products and services relative to the Grain index annually, we can even determine the economic direction of a society and can better iron out kinks in a society&rsquo;s supply and demand.</p>
<p>We can even use the data to plot exactly when the grain ratios started to change so that we can pinpoint specific laws that caused the problem or improvement. We can trace objectively when the oligarchy started in the Philippines and when Vietnam became anti-rich, by getting their historical annual pantrynomic Purchasing Power even without any knowledge of historical events &ndash; this is what our machine learning is supposed to do.</p>
<p><img src="https://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/072415bigmac550.png" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>The Big Mac index  has some of the basic ideas of Smith's commodity-based valuation system, explained in the Digression, as it uses a real, useful thing to valuate a mere piece of paper with a number written on it.</figcaption>
<p>In contrast, modern Economics measures national wealth top-down through GDP and its sustainability through the CPI (consumer price index), both measured in currency.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult to value goods and services during bubbles and hyperinflation as what happened in Zimbabwe. If a financial crisis hits a pantrynomy, the valuation can merely switch to the Grain index to keep the supply chain humming.</p>
<p>Under Economics, a country can theoretically have a single giant corporation exporting everything, having huge GDP while its workers starve to produce those exports at low cost. A GDP standard would still rate the starving country as wealthy.</p>
<p>Our NDP standard, on the other hand, would properly expose the real poverty hidden by the nominal wealth just as it exposed the hidden middle-class poverty in Vietnam and the real poverty in the Philippines.</p>
<p>In addition, our Grain index eliminates the need for complicated subjective factors that are present in other indices like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index#Criticism">the Human Development Index</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Planet_Index#Criticism">Happy Planet Index</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD_Better_Life_Index#Criticism">Better Life Index</a>, etc. The subjectiveness is only in what items are pegged aganst the Grain index.</p>
<p>More importantly, our system retains democracy and does not degenerate into a <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit-system-explained">social credit system</a> while it reduces the cost of cirulating value throughout society.</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>The riches of a country does not consist in the amount of money used to circulate commerce, but in the great abundance of life's necessaries. We would greatly increase our country's wealth if we could find a way to send the half of our money abroad to be converted into goods, and supply the channel of circulation at home, at the same time.</p>
