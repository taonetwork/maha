          <p>Japan launched Quantitative Easing (QE)  as part of Abenomics which was announced in 2012, just as the US launched theirs after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Both actions failed to drive economic growth* for both countries and merely resulted in additional public debt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*The growth in the US really came from Trump&rsquo;s fiscal reforms and trade war</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To explain why QE was used and why it failed, we need to go back to 1913. In that year, the Federal Reserve (Fed) was established in the US to provide stability after the Panic of 1907. By the early 1920&rsquo;s, it had overstepped this function and had gone into open market operations and allowed banks to rediscount loans.</p>
<p>From providing stability, the Fed went for promoting growth&ndash;this is the first subtle mistake. <b>The job of growing the economy is done by commercial banking (the &ldquo;retailer&rdquo; of money). It is not done by central banking (the &ldquo;wholesaler&rdquo;* of money)</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*This will be the same reason why Modern Monetary Theory will fail – because the government only controls the wholesale of money and not its retail</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
<p>The circulation of every country is divided into two branches: the circulation of the dealers with one another, and the circulation between the dealers and the consumers.</p> 
<cite>Wealth of Nations Book 2 Chapter 2</cite>
</div>
<br>
<p>Such operations filled the economy with &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; money which then led to the second mistake &ndash; commercial banks enabling buying on margin. This filled the economy with &ldquo;retail&rdquo; money which fueled speculation, finally leading to the 1929 Crash.</p>
<p>Thus, it took two ingredients to cook up a money-crisis:</p>
<ol>
<li>The mistake of the central bank</li>
<li>The mistake of the commercial and investment banking system</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3 id="the-ayr-bank-and-the-credit-crisis-of-1772">The Ayr Bank and the Credit Crisis of 1772</h3>
<p>These two mistakes are similar to the ones that happened after the creation of the Ayr Bank in Britain that led to the 1772 Credit Crisis.</p>
<p>That bank was created in order to grow the economy by lending a lot of paper money* as bank notes, a relatively new invention back then. A lot of people really did borrow, to the point that the bank went out of business by 1772.</p>
<p>But unlike the 1929 crash that led to the Depression, the one in 1772 resolved itself naturally, with the Americans leaving Britain. This is similar to a potential Grexit as a consequence of the Greek Debt Crisis after 2008.</p>
<p><img src="http://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/banknote.jpg" alt="banknote"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>*According to Montesquieu, the Jews invented paper bills after they were expelled from France, so that they could use it to access their wealth which remained stuck in France</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what did 1772 do right to avoid the crisis experienced by 1929?</p>
<br>
<h2 id="1772-had-no-profit-maximization-and-no-liquidity-preference">1772 Had No Profit Maximization and No Liquidity Preference</h2>
<p>The main difference was that the doctrine of profit maximization did not exist back in 1772. Rather, it was practiced privately but not taught in schools.</p>
<p>It was only formalized in the 1870&rsquo;s* through the marginal revolution or Marginalism and subsequently taught by Alfred Marshall, a British economist. His work was then carried by Keynes, another British economist, who cites Marshall&rsquo;s work heavily. We can say that Keynes was a Marginalist too, aside from being anti-classical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*This is proven by Henry George&rsquo;s <i>Progress and Poverty</i> which talks about <a href="https://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp22.htm">the recession of 1879</a> which was caused by land speculation. <br>This caused him to absurdly advocate a single land tax to prevent such a recession. This is similar to Piketty advocating a wealth tax. <br>Both of them fail to see that taxes are decided by accountants and accountants can get creative in order to bypass such fiscal policies. <br>Pantrynomics advocates structural reform and overhaul that goes beyond the scope of accounting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main difference between Keynes and Marshall was, while Marshall valued real productivity as the cause of wealth, Keynes valued money as &lsquo;liquidity preference&rsquo;:</p>
<div class="squote keynes" data-sal="slide-right">The psychological time-preferences of an individual need two sets of decisions.. the "propensity to consume".. and his liquidity preference: How long does he intend to have his money savings and not spend it? The mistake of previous theories on the rate of interest is to neglect the liquidity preference. This neglect is what we are repairing. The ratio ofthe amount of moneyand the liquidity-preference determines the actual rate of interest in given circumstances.
<cite>Chapter 13. The General Theory of the Rate of Interest</cite>
</div>
<p>The difference between 1772 and 1929 is that <strong>the latter had profit maximization being taught to everyone</strong>. This led to a widespread accumulation of money which will only be spent <strong>IF</strong> there are profits to be made.</p>
<p>The problem is that <strong>profits decline through time as the lack in society is reduced</strong>. If everyone already has an iPhone, a car, and a house, then there would be no more demand for those things. This would then cause profits to decline &ndash; which is supposed to be a good thing.</p>
<p>But because of profit maximization, this becomes a bad thing. Unable to find higher profits naturally, people stop spending and investors stop investing. <strong>This stops the natural circulation of money</strong>.</p>
<p>With a lot of idle money in the economy, speculators see this as an opportunity to create attractive, profitable scams which lead to bubbles. This explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 1929 Crash in the US, after many years of the Roaring 20&rsquo;s</li>
<li>the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis, after many years of economic boom</li>
<li>the current rise in Bitcoin and crypto-bubbles</li>
</ul>
<!-- Instead of being spent to create jobs, the money was used instead for profitable speculation* into assets such as land and the stock market, leading to the 1929 Crash. -->
<br>
<h2 id="classical-economics-was-wiser">Classical Economics was wiser</h2>
<p>In the classical system, however, there is no profit maximization. People spend money liberally and accumulation does not become so widespread. Is there a demand for a railroad? Then let&rsquo;s build one*. Are more steamships needed? Let&rsquo;s borrow money to engineer one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*This actually led to overinvestment which led to too much employment by drawing job-seekers to a place. <!-- If the investment fails, then  hordes of unemployed humans suddenly appear. --> The proper solution is coordination, which we propose as an additional feature to EF Schumacher&rsquo;s Pool Clearing system explained later</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question in Classical Economics becomes <strong>the credit-worthiness</strong> of those who want to get loans to make good investments.</p>
<p>Thus, in the classical system, good investments are not forced. Instead, they are spotted by entrepreneurs and grown naturally through creditors who will give whatever interest rate is natural for that time.</p>
<p>An easy proof is Andrew Carnegie selling his steel company to JP Morgan at a non-profit maximizing price of $480m which was much lower than what JP Morgan was willing to pay. This allowed productivity to march forward naturally, instead of being stopped by the arbitrary gates of the profiteer.</p>
<p>Profit maximization explains why interest rates became so important to the Neoclassical system, but not so much to the Classical one. This is obvious in Keynes' reasoning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Life is determined by resources</li>
<li>Resources are determined by work and employment</li>
<li>Employment is determined by investment</li>
<li>
<div class="text-danger">Investment is determined by the interest rate</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="text-danger">Interest rate is determined by liquidity preference</div>
</li>
<li>Liquidity preference is determined by transactional motive and speculative motive</li>
<li>These motives are determined by expectation</li>
<li>Government policy on interest and public spending can affect this expectation and make people spend money in order to make an economy rise from the crash</li>
</ol>
<p>To support this logic, he created the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/islmmodel.asp">marginal efficiency of capital curve</a> which is the ratio between an investment&rsquo;s cost and its future revenue. The investment&rsquo;s cost is then determined by the interest rate.</p>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/is.jpg" width="300px">
<figcaption>Keynes treats money as wealth and so investments become objects that follow the demand curve</figcaption>
<p>In the classical system, however, entrepreneurs and investors won&rsquo;t be too fussy about this and would focus instead on getting that investment up and running ahead of the other guy.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that finance is actually <a href="/articles/pantrynomics/the-six-types-of-effort/">unproductive labor</a>! Financiers are useless in producing wealth just as the Roman legions were useless in producing crops that the Romans had to get from Egypt.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="the-mistakes-of-keynes">The Mistakes of Keynes</h2>
<p>In defining interest rate, Keynes makes a very critical mistake &ndash; he defines it as <strong>the reward for letting go of cash</strong>:</p>
<div class="squote keynes" data-sal="slide-right">
The rate of interest at any time is the reward for parting with liquidity.. It is the “price” which equilibrates the desire to hold wealth as cash..
<cite>The General Theory of the Rate of Interest</cite>
</div>
<p>This leads to his secondary mistake in asserting that interest rates can never be negative:</p>
<div class="squote keynes" data-sal="slide-right">
But the rate of interest is never negative. 
<cite>Chapter 13. The General Theory of the Rate of Interest</cite>
</div>
<p>The first mistake attaches the essence of interest to the existence of paper cash. This is wrong because interest is really the revenue from lending something to someone.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I lend you my pen with half an amount of ink and you return it with zero ink, then I would have lost utility in lending it to you. This would make me stop lending pens</li>
<li>If you give it back with full ink, then I would have gained 100% utility from lending it to you. This would then encourge me to lend you pens in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>From here, we can create our real-world interest rates:</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Interest rate</th>
<th>100%</th>
<th>0-10%</th>
<th>-100%</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Loan Terms</td>
<td>You can borrow my half-ink pen. But return it with full ink</td>
<td>You can borrow it, but must return it with the same 50% ink or a bit more</td>
<td>You can return the pen with no ink</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Effect</td>
<td>No one would borrow the pen. They would instead buy their own</td>
<td>This is normal and fair</td>
<td>This is unfair to the lender, but happens sometimes.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, negative interest rates of pens and even negative pen prices are possible. This is matched by the negative interest rates of money and the negative prices of oil &ndash; things that were thought impossible in the past.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/pen.jpg" alt="Ink as Interest Rates"></p>
<p>From the lender&rsquo;s perspective, the interest rate is merely the cost of lending. But from society&rsquo;s perspective, the interest indicates three things:</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Indicator</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The demand for pens</td>
<td>The fact that interest rates were formalized means that the pen-lending has become regular</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The credit-worthiness (quality) and use-volume (quantity) of the pen-users</td>
<td>From the lender&rsquo;s perspective, the existence of a lot scammer pen-borrowers will prompt him to charge a high interest on his ink in order to reduce the demand, and let the revenue make up for the ink lost to scammers. In the absence of scammers, a high interest rate means that there is too much demand for pen-borrowing which then shows a lot of pen-activity. The high rate discourages the non-serious demand for pens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The availability of pen-lenders</td>
<td>From the borrower&rsquo;s pespective, a high interest rate shows that the pen-owner can charge whatever he wants. In this sense, it is a sign of having too few pen-lenders.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can then substitute money for pens, so that a high interest rate for money could indicate:</p>
<br> 
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Indicator</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A high demand for money</td>
<td>A rapid economy will need more money and therefore increase interest rates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low credit-worthiness (quality) of borrowers</td>
<td>The high demand increases the number of borrowers and decreases their overall quality. This naturally leads to bust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Few banks or banks that are too consolidated</td>
<td>Generally, the competition between banks will reduce the interest rate.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">
A loan is usually done in money. But this is immediately turned into stock, and thus it is the quantity of stock that enables you to make more loans. <i>The rate of interest is entirely regulated by this circumstance.</i> If there were so many borrowers but only a few lenders then interest would be high. But if the amount of stock on hand were so great as to enable many to lend, then it would fall proportionably.
<cite>Lectures on Jurisprudence, Part 2, Section 2, Chapter 14</cite>
</div>
<br>
<h2 id="gr-model-is-society-credit-worthy-or-speculative">GR Model: Is Society Credit-worthy or Speculative?</h2>
<p>From the nature of lending and interest in society, we can expand Keynes' IS curve below to have an upward slope which we call the GR model where G stands for economic growth and R is the interest rate:</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/gr.png" alt="GR model as GDP-Interest rates curve"></p>
<figcaption>According to classical economics, interest is revenue in lending. This means it can rise and fall, different from Keynes' IS curve which only falls at more investments</figcaption>
<ul>
<li>In a poor society, the lender&rsquo;s risk is in the poor borrowers not being able to use the money productively. But if they do and the lending succeeds, then the revenue generated can increase the productivity of the poor society by a lot</li>
<li>In a wealthy sociey however, the lender&rsquo;s risk is in having too many rich borrowers trying to use money even if productivity has been maxed out. Their failure to use the money properly thencreates the usual bust after every boom</li>
</ul>
<p>From this U-shaped curve, we have a bigger perspective which we can base our definition of interest rates on:</p>
<div class="squote tao" data-sal="slide-right">The interest rate is the revenue in lending that is determined by the demand and credit-worthiness of the borrowers and the availability of the lenders.
</div>
<p>Having clear defintions is important because our goal is to automate the economy to prevent poverty and inequality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand: Resource-demand of the borrowers</li>
<li>Credit-worthiness of the borrowers: the productive use of whatever is lent, as to be able to return it</li>
<li>Availability of lenders: the savings or pool of resources</li>
</ul>
<br> 
<h3 id="the-effect-of-keynes-mistake">The Effect of Keynes' Mistake</h3>
<p>Keynes' biggest error is that his definition <strong>does not include credit worthiness</strong>. This causes central banks to pump money into <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124">commercial banks</a>* without bothering to know whether there are credit-worthy people to receive that money in the first place. This uncertainty prevents the money from actually going into employment, wages, and inclusive growth.</p>
<p>All it does is to increase government debt as it floods banks with money that finds no use and merely goes around to increase asset prices. It would be like a factory churning out wholesale products that never reach the end consumers. Instead, those products flood the warehouses for the benefit of the warehousing industry. The factory is the central bank, while the warehousing industry is the financial industry.</p>
<!-- The consumers then ask the factory where the products are  -->
<p>The idea of profit maximization then is like a gigantic money-bag that stores all the fiat from monetary easing that cannot find high profits in the real world.  The mergers and acquisitions in the &rsquo;90s made this finance-bag even bigger. It no longer becomes interested in funding small profit opportunities and instead just goes for financing big deals. This giant finance-bag* then matches the giant crises and the giant debt-bag of governments that really must be paid by the people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*The Nixon Shock created fiat which then gave power to commercial banking and then to development and investment banking, which are merely two sides of the same wealth-coin. This explains why they were very dominant from the &rsquo;70s to the late &rsquo;90s until their demise in the 1997 Asian Crisis and 2008 Financial Crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The robustness of our definition makes it applicable even to non-monetary items:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interest rate in car-lending is therevenue in lending cars that is determined by the demand and credit-worthiness of the car-borrowers and the availability of the car-lenders. (In this way, the interest of car-lending can be paid for in spare parts, gasoline, upgrades, or the usual cash)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can then implement the GR model by using GDP as G so that we can determine whether the lenders or the borrowers have more economic power in a society. A downward sloping line would mean more power to the lenders, while an upward sloping one means the borrowers have more power.</p>
<img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/gdp-ints2.jpg" width="300px">
<p>This chart shows that in the US, Brazil, Philippines, and Zimbabwe, the banks, both public and private, have more power. This is proven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 2008 Financial Crisis caused by US banks</li>
<li>The huge debt of Brazil and the Philippines caused by <a href="http://2040.neda.gov.ph/2017/03/06/yes-fiscal-spending-is-a-key-component-of-economic-growth/">their governments spending to drive growth</a></li>
<li>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s hyperinflation caused by the dictator Mugabe</li>
</ul>
<p>The situation is slightly different for Singapore and China where there is more balance. However, the case of Japan and Thailand shows a dominance of borrowers and is proven by two phenomena:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the prevalence of hot money in Thailand</li>
<li>Japan&rsquo;s Lost Decade began with its asset price bubble in 1991, signifying strength in borrowing. This matches our own conclusion that the cause of the failure of Abenomics  is in corporate Japan* <a href="/analysis/social-cycles/how-to-fix-japan">having too much strength over their banks</a>.</li>
</ul>
<!-- > *This is why our solution, as EF Schumacher's Pool Clearing, can be established in Japan after the coming financial crisis resulting from Covid debts -->
<p>Thus, a financial crisis can be caused by either the lenders or the borrowers. We cannot say that lending should be done by the government or by too-big-to-fail banks, nor can we say that banks should always make borrowers happy by liberalizing lending and flooding them with cheap money.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/fed1920.jpg" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>Interest rates rise just before a crash because of the high demand for money</figcaption>
<p>Since the GR model uses historical data, we can use it, in theory, to predict what interest rates are needed to create a certain GDP level. In the example below, it predicts that an interest of around 4.2% will lead to a 2% growth. In reality, the rate was 3.25% leading to a growth of 2.5%. Of course, this can be refined with more data.</p>

<p>Why did Keynes specify cash instead of money in his definition of interest rates?</p>
<p>This is because the boom of the 1920s was itself caused by the liquidity afforded by paper-based bank notes coming from the establishment of the Federal Reserve. Once a mind has experienced pleasures, it does not want to part with them. The pleasurable boom was caused by cash and so it became Keynes' interest to enshrine cash and denounce gold, which is obviously harder to circulate than paper. But this difficulty in circulation is exactly what gives gold its stability.</p>
<div class="squote keynes" data-sal="slide-right">
If we restore the gold standard, are we to return also to the pre-war conceptions of bank-rate.. or allow.. the depletion [of our gold reserves]? In truth, the gold standard is already a barbarous relic.
<cite>A Tract on Monetary Reform</cite>
</div>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/paper.jpg" alt="John Maynard Keynes saying Paper is Money"></p>
<figcaption>Thomas Mun enshrined the idea that money is wealth in 1664. In 1936, Keynes likewise enshrined the idea that paper is money and therefore cash is wealth </figcaption>
<!-- that people desire, as "liquidity preference". -->
<p>Keynes falls hook, line, and sinker for the mercantilist doctrine that money is wealth:</p>
<div class="squote smith" data-sal="slide-right">Money..frequently signifies wealth, and this ambiguity of expression has rendered this popular notion so familiar to us that even they who are convinced of its absurdity are very apt to.. take it for granted as an.. undeniable truth. Some of the best English writers upon commerce set out with observing that the wealth of a country consists, not in its gold and silver only, but in its lands, houses, and consumable goods.. In the course of their reasonings, however, the lands, houses, and consumable goods seem to slip out of their memory, and.. their argument frequently supposes that all wealth consists in gold and silver, and that to multiply those metals is the great object of national industry and commerce.
<cite>Wealth of Nations Book 4, Chapter 1.34</cite>

<p>The love of money causes the marginalists to teach the doctrine of profit maximization to all, eventually leading to the 1929 Crash. They then blame Classical Economics for the problem created by Marginalism, which they propose to solve by pumping even more money to feed the animal spirits of speculators, investors, and businessmen already programmed into profit maximization.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open market operations and negative interest rates (QE) fill the financial industry with money</li>
<li>&ldquo;Deficit spending&rdquo; and &ldquo;bailouts&rdquo; by governments fill corporations with money in the hopes for a &ldquo;multiplier effect&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>These two solutions benefit banks and corporations at the cost of public debt which must be paid by income taxes and sales taxes from wage earners. These solve stagnation and recession by energizing the former and dragging the latter to go with them. This is similar to a Roman empire slave master driving growth by driving his slaves to work more.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/wagegap.jpg" alt="Wage gap"></p>
<p>This inequality manifests as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The gigantic growth of financial assets via wholesale money to enrich the financial industry. This causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>huge debts that lead to deficient government services and political instability:
<ul>
<li>the Communist revolution in South America in the 60s-70s was caused by the Latin american debt crisis</li>
<li>the Asian Crisis of 1997 caused the instability in Asia</li>
<li>the 2008 Financial Crisis caused the Eurozone Crisis and Arab Spring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>price inflation of assets such as stocks and real estate that further fuels inequality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sucking of productivity from the working class through the 2% inflation target to enrich the investors and corporations via retail money. This causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the productivity-wage gap</li>
<li>bullshit jobs</li>
<li>the need for two or more jobs to meet inflation</li>
<li>reduced competitiveness of the economy
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-solutions">The Solutions</h2>
<p>Because Marginalism created two problems, one for wholesale money and another for retail money, Pantrynomics as Classical Economics also has two solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A modified version of <a href="/solutions/social/how-multilateral-pool-clearing-can-solve-currency-crises">Pool Clearing from EF Schumacher</a> which uses Clearing Funds to replace the finance-moneybag. The money in Clearing Funds go directly to manufacturers, producers, and service providers. Its interest rates are determined by the GR model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero inflation target through a tri-media system of exchange using fiat, barter (as economic social contracts), and points (as basic universal revenue). This includes replacing the profit maximization of Marginalism with the <a href="/articles/pantrynomics/the-effort-theory-of-value">Effort Theory of Value</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The original credit-worthiness problem in Classical Economics will be addressed by a prediction system that uses machine learning system called <a href="/articles/superphysics/what-is-isaiah">ISAIAH</a>. This is already done by fintech companies that use AI to predict credit scores. Our innovation will be to extend it to everyone through a moneyless system.</p>
