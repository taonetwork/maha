          <p>The previous post explained the concept of <a href="/material/qost">Qosts or the quantum of space time</a>. These are points in spacetime that gather energy to create mass in order to create discrete things. These create spacetime by their mutual repulsion which manifests as gravity. These are therefore essential in levitation and teleportation within space.</p>
<br>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5rqnidVUkY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="What are Oosts?"></iframe>
</div>

<br>
<p>These can also be employed to harness energy, as opposed to creating it, in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By tapping into the repulsion of qosts that lead to the accelerated expansion of space. This is like a windmill tapping the energy from the wind and can be classified sa free energy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By extracting the energy from the atomic reactions of the material layer. This is how fission and fusion extracts energy. This requires an input, such as hydrogen and is therefore non-free energy. However, it extracts more energy in a shorter time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Physicists are going for the second approach after learning how to extract atomic energy in the 1940&rsquo;s through nuclear fission reactions, as a consequence of atomic theory. However, fission is limited and dangerous. This led them to go for fusion which is supposed to be clean and safe.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="the-fusion-solution">The Fusion Solution</h2>
<p>Fusion is done by heating hydrogen into a plasma as to create energy. In a star, this plasma is confined by a gravitational field from the star&rsquo;s qost. This allows the hydrogen to get compressed which creates mass which adds more gravity and consequently, more heat. This then creates fusion which releases energy as starlight and sunshine.</p>
<p>Without this confinement, the star would dissipate immediately. And so, the extreme confinement and compression is the key to fusion.</p>
<p>Humans try to recreate fusion by using magnetism instead of artificial gravity to confine the plasma. The problem is that magnetism uses up electrical energy in the process. This makes the input cost of outputting fusion energy very high. When added to all the cost of making the reactor and its maintenance, it can possibly lead to loss. This makes fusion-by-magnetism commercially unviable &ndash; a sheer waste of money, time, and effort, similar to the wasteful expense for dark matter detectors which have detected nothing and will detect nothing.</p>
<p>Physicists think that somehow, adding more electricty will make the process more efficient.  This arises from materialist thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you want your rocket to go farther, just add more fuel</li>
<li>if you want to win a war, just add more troops to your army</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that this method only applies to the last three layers of our five layer model, specifically, the electromagnetic, radioactive, and material layers.</p>
<p><img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/layers.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It does not apply to the upper two layers of the spatial or aetheric, where crudity is replaced by precision and sophistication. The technological designs for the lower three layers are so simplistic:</p>
<ul>
<li>the general design of combustion-based rockets is based on a simple tube</li>
<li>all air-based airplanes are a tubes with two wings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-spatial-layer">The Spatial Layer Requires Sophistication</h3>
<p>The Spatial (gravitational layer) is different because it is based on points, and points connected with other points lead to geometries. These are then manipulated by the upper aetherial layer which is based on waves, examples of which are sounds and waves of feelings. In the aethereal layer, the points of the spatial layer manifest as discrete ideas instead of discrete objects and matter.</p>
<p>Historically, these geometries manifest as pyramids and pyramid blocks which must be precise as to fit perfectly like lego bricks.</p>
<p>In fusion, these geometries manifest as the different shapes of the fusion reactors which represent the different ways of confining material plasma, as explained <a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-021-03401-w/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>These can be grouped into two:</p>

<li>Linear fusion reactors (Reactor 4)</li>
</ol>
<p>These are used by advanced alien civilizations as the basis of their UFO design:</p>
<ol>
<li>Round reactors lead to spherical UFOs as flying saucers</li>
<li>Linear reactors lead to cigar shaped ones</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/ufo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that alien civilizations have figured out how to harness fusion. But what is missing in the human version?</p>
<h2 id="artificial-gravitation-is-missing">Artificial Gravitation is Missing</h2>
<p>The main problem is that physicists haven&rsquo;t discovered the underlying principles for gravitation. Currently, this is supposed to be done by Einstein&rsquo;s General Relativity (GR). However, upon closer inspection of <a href="/solutions/material/how-to-fix-general-relativity">his theory</a>, it&rsquo;s clear that GR is merely Special Relativity (SR) applied to cosmic objects. The proof is the necessity of light to prove GR:</p>
<ul>
<li>gravitational waves are detected by LIGO which uses light-based lasers</li>
<li>gravitational lensing is detected by light from other stars</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that SR is based on the principles of electromagnetism, which is the lower layer under gravitation (spatial layer). This leads to absurd concepts like a singularity that defies physics. The predictions of GR are only true for whatever is <strong>visible</strong> in the universe. It doesn&rsquo;t apply to invisible things, such as dark matter, actual black holes, and the <strong>relationships</strong> between different cosmic objects.</p>
<p>Hindu and Buddhist monks have figured out all the five layers of the universe and that&rsquo;s why they ended up denouncing physical reality. Instead of immersing in the material world, they focus on the highest aethereal layer which is pure metaphysics. A side-effect of this is having <em>siddhas</em> or supernatural powers. They are only &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; because the human definition of the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; world is the universe that lies in the four lower layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spatial (gravitational force)</li>
<li>Electromagnetic (eletromagnetic force)</li>
<li>Radioactive (weak force)</li>
<li>Material (strong force)</li>
</ol>
<p>One of these powers is to levitate using their center of gravity.</p>

<p>This shows how low energy input, without any fuel source, can produce work as to lift a man. This is the same technique used by UFO&rsquo;s to lift themselves without needing boosters nor bulky fuel tanks. This is the first power-generation method that we mentioned being simiar to windmills.</p>
<p>This can be applied to fusion as the alternate way to confine plasma as to create high energy output using very low energy input. Deuterium can be added to make this power-generation system output more energy to power entire civilizations.</p>
<p>In fact, magnetism plays a very negligible role in this type of fusion because if a UFO&rsquo;s reactor were mostly magnetized then it would be left behind whenever the UFO teleportated to another location!</p>
<p>In this method, the plasma itself creates the gravitational field by creating a vortex in the center. This is similar to a pyramid that uses its tip as the vortex for the Earth, like an antenna.</p>
<p>Of the current fusion designs, this is what the twisty stellarator is trying to do. However, it still needs to be overhauled as to create a vortex which will create gravity which will confine it and make it sustainable. This will allow it to be reduced in size as to be able to fit large vehicles. This vortex-stellarator can then assume either the round or linear shape:</p>
<ol>
<li>The round twisty reactor is the compact version, useful for small vehicles</li>
<li>The linear twisty version is for large vehicles</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/phoenix.jpg" alt=""></p>
<figcaption>The large 'Phoenix' UFO uses two linear reactors shaped as a V, giving it much more power than a saucer or cigar UFO</figcaption>
<br>
<h2 id="so-how-do-we-get-there">So how do we get there?</h2>
<p>Since artificial gravitation is the key ingredient to sustainable fusion, the first step is to actually levitate things without using electricity. This was done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ancient Egyptians to lift pyramid blocks</li>
<li>the Israelites* who used trumpets to amplify the gravitation of the walls of Jericho as to make them collapse</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>*The Israelites came from Egypt, so their scientists (priests) would have some idea of how the gravity tech of the Egyptians worked</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of trumpets by the Israelites is consistent with Kepler who wrote about the Harmony of the Universe, consistent with Socrates and Pythagoras:</p>
<div class="squote kepler">
a great distinction exists between the consonances of the single planets which have been unfolded and the consonances of the planets in pairs. The single ones cannot exist at the same moment, but the pairs absolutely can. This is because the same planet, moving at its aphelion, cannot be at the opposite perihelion at the same time. But of two planets, one can be at its aphelion and the other at its perihelion. <br><br>And so the ratio of plain-song or monody, which we call "choral music" and which alone was known to the ancients, 1 to polyphony—called "figured song,"; 2 the invention of the latest generations—is the same as the ratio of the consonances which the single planets designate to the consonances of the planets taken together.
<cite>Johanes Kepler</cite>

<p>Material Superphysics builds on Kepler&rsquo;s Laws to rebuild the principles of the material Universe from the perspective of the Supreme Entity instead of the shallow human view. This bypasses everything from Aristotle to Ptolemy, and Newton to Einstein, who created Physics principles from a shallow observation of cause and effect:</p>
<br>

<th>Nonmaterialist Camp</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Aristotle, Ptolemy (Earth is the center)</td>
<td>Aristarchus, Copernicus (the sun is the center)</td>

<tr>
<td>Newton, Einstein (Mass creates gravity)</td>
<td>Kepler, Galileo (Gravity is from the foci* of two objects)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<blockquote>
<p>*Material Superphysics develops Kepler&rsquo;s foci concept into qosts</p>
</blockquote>

 -->
<p>So the steps towards sustainable fusion are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Levitate something without electricity in order to derive principles (formulas)</li>
<li>Apply those principles to metals to find the geometry for their vortex point, as an artificial qost</li>
<li>Use that geometry to tap reliable but low power spacetime energy</li>
<li>Pool that energy to create plasma</li>
<li>Make that plasma flow* to create a vortex to confine itself gravitationally, leading to sustained fusion</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>*The TAE reactor has this idea, but because it has no concept of gravitation, it has no choice but to raise the plasma to extreme heat which will make the whole thing wasteful</p>
